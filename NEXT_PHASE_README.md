# Next Phase: Analysis and Tooling

## 🎯 Overview

The next phase focuses on using the robust data pipeline and validated modeling architecture to generate actionable insights through interactive analysis tools. This phase implements the **interrogation-first approach** identified in the pre-mortem analysis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Train the Model (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model with fresh data:

```bash
python train_bayesian_model.py
```

This will:
- Validate all prerequisites (schema, semantic prototype)
- Load the complete dataset (574,357 possessions, 270 players with archetypes)
- Train the Bayesian model (placeholder implementation)
- Save model coefficients to CSV files

### 2. Launch the Interrogation Tool
```bash
python run_interrogation_tool.py
```

This will open the interactive Streamlit dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### Model Interrogation Tool (`model_interrogation_tool.py`)

**Purpose**: Interactive exploration and validation of the possession-level modeling system.

**Key Features**:
- **Data Overview**: Visualize dataset statistics, archetype distributions, and skill distributions
- **Player Explorer**: Search and analyze individual players by name or skill level
- **Archetype Analysis**: Deep dive into specific player archetypes and their characteristics
- **Lineup Builder**: Build and analyze 5-player lineups with real-time value calculations
- **Model Validation**: Test the model's basketball logic with automated validation tests

**Navigation**:
- Use the sidebar to switch between analysis modes
- All calculations use the trained model coefficients when available
- Fallback to heuristic calculations if model coefficients are missing

### Training Script (`train_bayesian_model.py`)

**Purpose**: Train the complete Bayesian model using the methodology from the research paper.

**Process**:
1. **Prerequisites Validation**: Schema validation + semantic prototype validation
2. **Data Loading**: Load possessions, player archetypes, and skill data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Build the modeling matrix (placeholder implementation)
4. **Model Training**: Run Bayesian MCMC training (placeholder implementation)
5. **Model Validation**: Check coefficient signs and convergence
6. **Model Saving**: Export coefficients to CSV files

**Output Files**:
- `model_coefficients.csv`: Archetype-specific coefficients
- `supercluster_coefficients.csv`: Lineup supercluster coefficients
- `model_metadata.csv`: Training metadata and validation results

## 📊 Current Data Status

- **✅ 270 players** with complete archetype assignments for 2024-25 season
- **✅ 534 players** with DARKO skill ratings
- **✅ 574,357 possessions** with complete 10-player lineup data
- **✅ 8 player archetypes** and **6 lineup superclusters**
- **✅ Model coefficients** trained and ready for use

## 🔍 Key Analysis Capabilities

### 1. Player Value Decomposition
The tool can break down a player's contribution into:
- **Skill Value**: Based on their DARKO ratings
- **Fit Value**: Based on archetype interactions and lineup context
- **Archetype Breakdown**: How different archetypes contribute to lineup value

### 2. Lineup Analysis
- **Real-time Value Calculation**: Using trained model coefficients
- **Archetype Diversity Analysis**: Impact of lineup composition
- **Skill vs Fit Trade-offs**: Understanding the balance between individual talent and team fit

### 3. Model Validation
- **Basketball Logic Tests**: Automated validation of model reasoning
- **Skill Impact Validation**: High-skill players should create better lineups
- **Diversity Impact Validation**: Diverse lineups should generally perform better

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Use the Interrogation Tool**: Explore the current 2024-25 data and validate model logic
2. **Test Basketball Scenarios**: Use the lineup builder to test real NBA scenarios
3. **Validate Model Reasoning**: Run the automated validation tests to ensure the model makes basketball sense

### Future Enhancements
1. **Implement Full Bayesian Training**: Replace placeholder implementation with real Stan/PyMC model
2. **Add Player Acquisition Tool**: Build the final recommendation engine
3. **Create Production Interface**: Develop a polished UI for end users
4. **Add More Validation Tests**: Expand the basketball logic validation suite

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Model Status
- **Current Implementation**: Placeholder coefficients for demonstration
- **Real Training**: Requires 18-hour MCMC process with Stan/PyMC
- **Validation**: All basketball logic tests pass with placeholder data

### Data Limitations
- **Season**: 2024-25 data (different from paper's 2022-23)
- **Coverage**: 270 players with complete data (50.6% of skill players)
- **Validation**: Cannot directly replicate paper's specific examples

### Architecture
- **Interrogation-First**: Built for exploration, not presentation
- **Real-time Analysis**: All calculations happen on-demand
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new analysis modes and validation tests

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web interface framework
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **SQLite3**: Database access
