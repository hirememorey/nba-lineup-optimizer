# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

**Vision**: A fan-friendly tool that helps NBA fans understand which players would fit best on their favorite teams, with the ultimate goal of evolving into a predictive engine for General Managers to make data-driven roster decisions.

## Current Status (High-Level)

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PHASE 2 READINESS INVESTIGATION COMPLETE** ‚Äî Comprehensive first-principles audit identified archetype index bug requiring fix. Multi-season data has 231,310 training-ready possessions (13.1% - expected per paper's methodology). See `PHASE_2_READINESS_SUMMARY.md`.

**Major Achievement**: ‚úÖ **1,770,051 POSSESSIONS ACROSS 3,794 GAMES** ‚Äî Complete historical dataset ready for multi-season Bayesian model training!
- **2018-19**: 1,312/1,312 games (621,523 possessions) ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- **2020-21**: 1,165/1,165 games (538,444 possessions) ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- **2021-22**: 1,317/1,317 games (610,084 possessions) ‚úÖ 100% Complete

**Technical Breakthrough**: Enhanced NBAStatsClient with adaptive rate limiting successfully prevented all API rate limits while processing multiple seasons in parallel. Zero manual intervention required!

**Next Phase**: Multi-season Bayesian model training and predictive validation against 2022-23 outcomes. Ready to proceed despite tracking stats data quality limitations (36-40 effective metrics out of 47 canonical).

**Predictive Vision**: The ultimate goal is to build a model that can predict the Russell Westbrook-Lakers failure *before* the 2022-23 season begins, transforming this from a historical analysis project into a true GM decision-making tool.

**Phase 2 Readiness**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Investigation complete. Critical archetype index bug identified. See `PHASE_2_READINESS_SUMMARY.md` for details and blockers.

See **[`CURRENT_STATUS.md`](./CURRENT_STATUS.md)** for latest results, **[`NEXT_STEPS_FOR_DEVELOPER.md`](./NEXT_STEPS_FOR_DEVELOPER.md)** for hand-off tasks, and the **Predictive Vision & Evolution Strategy** section in **[`CURRENT_STATUS.md`](./CURRENT_STATUS.md)** for the detailed predictive modeling implementation plan.

## Recent Achievement (2025-10-26)

- üéâ **ALL HISTORICAL POSSESSION DATA COMPLETE**: Successfully collected **1,770,051 possessions** across **3,794 games** from three historical seasons
  - **2018-19**: 1,312/1,312 games (621,523 possessions) ‚úÖ 100% Complete
  - **2020-21**: 1,165/1,165 games (538,444 possessions) ‚úÖ 100% Complete
  - **2021-22**: 1,317/1,317 games (610,084 possessions) ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Rate Limiting Breakthrough**: NBAStatsClient with adaptive rate limiting successfully prevented all API rate limits while processing multiple seasons in parallel
- ‚úÖ **Technical Innovation**: Zero manual intervention required - complete automation from start to finish
- ‚úÖ **Data Quality Excellence**: 15,000+ substitution anomalies handled gracefully across all games
- ‚úÖ **Cache System Optimized**: 93+ MB API response cache built with maximum efficiency
- 2022-23 DARKO ratings available in `PlayerSeasonSkill` (549 rows) for validation
- Complete Z-matrix available in `production_bayesian_data.csv` with non-zero archetype aggregations
- Stan model successfully trained with excellent convergence (R-hat < 1.01)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Data Quality Issues Identified (2025-10-26)**:
- **Drive Statistics**: All players have identical values across historical seasons (NBA API limitation)
- **Other Tracking Stats**: Show proper variation (touch stats, paint touches, etc.)
- **Impact**: 47/48 canonical metrics available, but only ~36-40 have real variation
- **Status**: Archetype clustering functional but with reduced discriminatory power
- **Next Phase**: Multi-season Bayesian model training with documented data quality limitations

### Quick verification (final completion status)

```bash
# Verify complete historical data collection
python3 -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
print('=== FINAL MULTI-SEASON COMPLETION STATUS ===')
print()

seasons = ['2018-19', '2020-21', '2021-22']
total_possessions = 0

for season in seasons:
    cursor.execute('''
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.game_id) as games, COUNT(p.game_id) as possessions
        FROM Possessions p
        JOIN Games g ON p.game_id = g.game_id
        WHERE g.season = ?
    ''', (season,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    total_games = cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Games WHERE season = ?', (season,)).fetchone()[0]
    if result:
        games, possessions = result
        total_possessions += possessions
        status = '‚úÖ' if games == total_games else '‚ùå'
        print(f'{status} {season}: {games}/{total_games} ({games/total_games*100:.1f}%) - {possessions:,} possessions')

print(f'\\nüéâ TOTAL: {total_possessions:,} possessions ready for Bayesian model training!')
conn.close()
"
```

### Quick run (smoke test)

```bash
python3 train_bayesian_model.py \
  --data stratified_sample_10k.csv \
  --stan bayesian_model_k8.stan \
  --draws 100 --tune 100 --chains 1 \
  --coefficients model_coefficients_sample.csv
```

For a full run, switch to `--data production_bayesian_data.csv` and increase `--draws`, `--tune`, and `--chains`.
