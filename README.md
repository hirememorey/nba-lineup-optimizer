# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

The project has recently undergone a complete architectural redesign based on first-principles reasoning and is now ready for analysis.

## Current Status

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **NEW ARCHITECTURE COMPLETED - READY FOR ANALYSIS**

The new data pipeline is robust, validated, and capable of handling the inherent complexities and sparsity of NBA data.

-   **Data Pipeline**: The new mapping-first, sparsity-aware pipeline is complete.
-   **Available Metrics**: 41 of the 47 canonical metrics (87.2%) required by the paper have been successfully mapped to the NBA API.
-   **Known Missing Metrics**: 6 metrics (related to average shot distance and wingspan) are confirmed to be unavailable from the primary API endpoints. The system is designed to handle this.
-   **Next Step**: The project is ready for the core analysis phase.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nba-lineup-optimizer.git
cd nba-lineup-optimizer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Data Pipeline

This command orchestrates the entire process of discovering, fetching, and validating the data required for the analysis.

```bash
python master_data_pipeline.py --season 2024-25
```

### 3. Verify Data Quality

Run the verification tool to get a comprehensive report on the quality, completeness, and consistency of the fetched data.

```bash
python data_verification_tool.py
```

### 4. Handle Missing Data (If Needed)

Use the imputation tool to handle any missing values using ML-based strategies.

```bash
python data_imputation_tool.py --strategy auto
```

### 5. Run the Analysis

With a clean dataset, you can now proceed to the analysis phase.

```bash
# Follow the instructions in the "Running the Analysis" guide
```
