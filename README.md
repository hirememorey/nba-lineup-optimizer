# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

**Vision**: A fan-friendly tool that helps NBA fans understand which players would fit best on their favorite teams.

## Current Status (High-Level)

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: ðŸš€ **BAYESIAN MODEL IMPLEMENTATION** - Data Prep & Prototyping Complete

The project has successfully completed its data collection and foundational modeling phases. The core logic for the Bayesian model has been prototyped and validated, de-risking the most complex parts of the project.

**Next Phase**: The immediate priorities are to implement the lineup supercluster mapping and build the final validation harness before training the full model. For a detailed breakdown, please see **[`CURRENT_STATUS.md`](./CURRENT_STATUS.md)**.
