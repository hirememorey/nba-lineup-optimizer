# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

**Vision**: A fan-friendly tool that helps NBA fans understand which players would fit best on their favorite teams, with real-world examples like why Russell Westbrook struggled with the Lakers but succeeded with the Clippers and Nuggets. The system will eventually expand to evaluate G-League players for finding hidden gems and role players.

The project is now implementing a validation-first approach: reproduce the original paper with 2022-23 data to validate our implementation, then scale to current data for real-time relevance.

## Current Status

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: üöÄ **BAYESIAN MODEL IMPLEMENTATION** - Data Collection Complete
