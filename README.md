# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

**Vision**: A fan-friendly tool that helps NBA fans understand which players would fit best on their favorite teams, with real-world examples like why Russell Westbrook struggled with the Lakers but succeeded with the Clippers and Nuggets. The system will eventually expand to evaluate G-League players for finding hidden gems and role players.

The project is now implementing a validation-first approach: reproduce the original paper with 2022-23 data to validate our implementation, then scale to current data for real-time relevance.

## Current Status

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - All Data Successfully Integrated

The NBA Lineup Optimizer has completed its foundational infrastructure and successfully integrated all critical data sources. Phase 1 data collection is now complete and ready for original paper reproduction.

### What's Working Now ‚úÖ

- **Basketball Language**: Uses positions (PG, SG, SF, PF, C) and roles instead of technical archetypes
- **Player Search**: Name-based search with instant fit analysis
- **Team Analysis**: Roster display with position balance and needs identification
- **Free Agent Recommendations**: Team-specific player recommendations with basketball explanations
- **Production Dashboard**: Web interface with authentication and monitoring
- **Data Pipeline**: 651 players with complete data coverage and 574,357 possessions
- **2022-23 Data Collection**: Successfully collected 539 players with 40/47 canonical metrics (97.6% success rate)
- **DARKO Skill Ratings**: Successfully integrated 549 players with complete offensive/defensive ratings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ (for production features)
*   Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
*   Git

### Quick Start (Fan-Friendly Dashboard) üèÄ

**For NBA fans who want to explore player-team fit:**

```bash
# Start the fan-friendly dashboard
python run_fan_dashboard.py

# Access at http://localhost:8501
```

**Features:**
- Select any of 30 NBA teams
- Search players by name
- Get basketball-intuitive fit explanations
- View free agent recommendations
- Analyze team roster balance

### Quick Start (Production Deployment)

#### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nba-lineup-optimizer.git
cd nba-lineup-optimizer

# Deploy the complete production system
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Access dashboard at http://localhost:8502
```

#### Option 2: Direct Python Deployment

print(f"Predicted outcome: {result.predicted_outcome}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
print(f"Breakdown: {result.breakdown}")
