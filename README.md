## Data Architecture

The project uses a multi-database architecture with data distributed across three SQLite files:

- **Primary Database**: `src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db` - Contains processed, analysis-ready data
- **Secondary Database**: `nba_data.db` - Contains raw player tracking data
- **Tertiary Database**: `nba_lineup_data.db` - Contains lineup-specific data

For detailed information about the database structure, see `docs/data_dictionary.md`.

## Missing Metrics Investigation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - October 1, 2025

A comprehensive investigation was conducted to identify sources for the 7 missing canonical metrics required by the source paper. The investigation used a `curl`-first, manual validation approach to ensure accuracy.

**Key Findings**:
- **6 of 7 metrics identified and sourced**: `AVGDIST`, `Zto3r`, `THto10r`, `TENto16r`, `SIXTto3PTr`, and `HEIGHT`
- **1 metric requires external sourcing**: `WINGSPAN` (not available via NBA Stats API)
- **Critical technical requirement**: NBA Stats API now requires complete browser-generated headers for all requests

**Implementation Plan**: See `docs/metric_investigation_summary.md` for detailed findings and implementation recommendations.
