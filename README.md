## ModelEvaluator Foundation

**✅ COMPLETE:** The ModelEvaluator foundation provides a bulletproof core library for all NBA lineup analysis tools. This implementation directly addresses the critical failure mode identified in pre-mortem analysis.

### Key Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: All tools (validation, acquisition, optimization) use the same ModelEvaluator library
- **Defensive Programming**: System is architecturally incapable of processing incomplete player data
- **Evidence-Driven Development**: Built on actual data reality, not documentation assumptions
- **Comprehensive Validation**: 16/16 technical tests passing, 85.7% basketball intelligence validation

### Core Components
- **ModelEvaluator Library** (`src/nba_stats/model_evaluator.py`): Main library with defensive data handling
- **Database Mapping System** (`src/nba_stats/db_mapping.py`): Anti-corruption layer for schema inconsistencies
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/test_model_evaluator.py`): 16 tests covering all edge cases
- **Validation Suite** (`validate_model.py`): Basketball intelligence validation (85.7% pass rate)

### Data Reality
- **270 blessed players** with complete skills + archetypes data
- **50.6% data completeness** (270 out of 534 skill players have archetypes)
- **Schema mappings** handle database reality vs. documentation mismatch

## Possession-Level Modeling System

**✅ COMPLETE:** The possession-level modeling system implements the core methodology from the research paper, enabling player acquisition recommendations based on team fit analysis.

### System Architecture
- **Continuous Schema Validation**: Prevents data drift with runtime gates
- **Semantic Prototyping**: Fast analytical logic validation (60 seconds vs 18 hours)
- **Database Mapping Layer**: Anti-corruption layer for schema inconsistencies
- **Evidence-Driven Development**: Data archaeology before assumptions

### Key Components

## Quick Start Guide

**✅ READY TO PROCEED:** The analysis tools are now fully operational. The system is ready for interactive exploration and lineup optimization.

### 1. Setup

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nba-lineup-optimizer.git
cd nba-lineup-optimizer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
```

### 2. Launch the Interactive Analysis Tool

**✅ NEW**: The interactive tool is the best way to explore the system and validate the model.

```bash
# Launch the Streamlit dashboard
python run_interrogation_tool.py
```

This will open the interactive tool at `http://localhost:8501` with 5 analysis modes:
- **Data Overview**: Visualize dataset statistics and distributions
- **Player Explorer**: Search and analyze individual players
- **Archetype Analysis**: Deep dive into specific player archetypes
- **Lineup Builder**: Build and analyze 5-player lineups
- **Model Validation**: Test the model's basketball logic

### 3. Train the Model (Optional)

If you want to retrain the model with fresh data:

```bash
# Train the Bayesian model
python train_bayesian_model.py
```

This will validate prerequisites, load data, and train the model using the methodology from the research paper.

### 4. Run Programmatic Demo (Optional)

To see the capabilities without the web interface:

```bash
# Run the programmatic demo
python demo_interrogation.py
```

This demonstrates all key features including player search, lineup analysis, and archetype exploration.

### 5. Explore the Data

The system includes rich data for analysis:
- **270 players** with complete archetype and skill data for 2024-25 season
- **574,357 possessions** with complete 10-player lineup information
- **8 player archetypes** and **6 lineup superclusters**
- **Trained model coefficients** ready for lineup value calculations

### 6. Next Steps

Once you're familiar with the system:
1. **Build lineups** using the Lineup Builder to test different combinations
2. **Validate model logic** using the automated basketball tests
3. **Explore archetypes** to understand how different player types interact
4. **Analyze real scenarios** using current 2024-25 NBA data

## Data Architecture

The project uses a multi-database architecture with data distributed across three SQLite files:

- **Primary Database**: `src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db` - Contains processed, analysis-ready data
- **Secondary Database**: `nba_data.db` - Contains raw player tracking data
- **Tertiary Database**: `nba_lineup_data.db` - Contains lineup-specific data

For detailed information about the database structure, see `docs/data_dictionary.md`.

## Missing Metrics Investigation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - October 1, 2025

A comprehensive investigation was conducted to identify sources for the 7 missing canonical metrics required by the source paper. The investigation used a `curl`-first, manual validation approach to ensure accuracy.

**Key Findings**:
- **6 of 7 metrics identified and sourced**: `AVGDIST`, `Zto3r`, `THto10r`, `TENto16r`, `SIXTto3PTr`, and `HEIGHT`
- **1 metric requires external sourcing**: `WINGSPAN` (not available via NBA Stats API)
- **Critical technical requirement**: NBA Stats API now requires complete browser-generated headers for all requests

**Implementation Plan**: See `docs/metric_investigation_summary.md` for detailed findings and implementation recommendations.
