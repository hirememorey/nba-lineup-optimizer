# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

The project has recently undergone a complete architectural redesign based on first-principles reasoning and is now in the final stages of implementation.

## Current Status

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Player Archetypes Generated and Ready for Bayesian Modeling**

The project has successfully completed the critical phase of determining optimal K-values and generating player archetypes. A comprehensive, data-driven analysis using PCA-based feature engineering has produced three basketball-meaningful archetypes that are ready for integration into the Bayesian possession-level modeling system.

### What's Working ‚úÖ

*   **Complete Tooling Suite**:
    *   **Model Governance Dashboard**: For structured human validation of model coefficients.
    *   **Player Acquisition Tool**: To find the best 5th player for a 4-player core.
    *   **Interactive Analysis Platform**: A Streamlit UI with 6 analysis modes for deep exploration.
*   **Robust Data Pipeline**: A reliable and resumable data pipeline is in place.
*   **ModelEvaluator Foundation**: A "bulletproof" core library provides a single source of truth for all analysis.
*   **Complete Data Coverage**: All critical player tracking statistics are now fully populated:
    *   **Drive Statistics**: 269 players (99.6% coverage)
    *   **Post-up Play**: 137 players (50.7% coverage)
    *   **Pull-up Shooting**: 263 players (97.4% coverage)
    *   **Paint Touches**: 270 players (100% coverage)
    *   **Front Court Touches**: 270 players (100% coverage)
    *   **Elbow Touches**: 270 players (100% coverage)
    *   **Passing Stats**: 270 players (100% coverage)
    *   **Opponent Shooting Stats**: 569 players (100% coverage) ‚úÖ **RECENTLY FIXED**
*   **Comprehensive Database**: 270 players with complete archetype features, 574k+ possessions, and all supporting data.

### Player Archetypes Generated ‚úÖ (October 3, 2025)

*   **Optimal K-Value Determination**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Used rigorous multi-metric evaluation to determine k=3 with PCA (80% variance) as optimal
*   **Feature Space Engineering**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implemented PCA-based dimensionality reduction (47 ‚Üí 13 components, 81.9% variance)
*   **Basketball-Meaningful Archetypes**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Generated three interpretable archetypes:
    *   **Big Men** (51 players, 18.7%): Valanƒçi≈´nas, Davis, Gobert, Giannis
    *   **Primary Ball Handlers** (86 players, 31.5%): LeBron, Curry, Durant, Harden  
    *   **Role Players** (136 players, 49.8%): Horford, Lopez, Batum, Holiday
*   **Quality Metrics**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Silhouette score: 0.235, Cluster balance: 0.375, Basketball interpretability: ‚úÖ
*   **Model Persistence**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All models and results saved for reproducibility

### Next Steps

The project is now ready for the next critical phase: **integrating the generated archetypes into the Bayesian possession-level modeling system** and completing the lineup supercluster analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nba-lineup-optimizer.git
cd nba-lineup-optimizer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
```

### 2. Verify Database Status

**CRITICAL**: Always run the comprehensive database verification before proceeding with analysis.

```bash
# Run comprehensive database sanity verification
python verify_database_sanity.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üéâ ALL CRITICAL VERIFICATIONS PASSED
Database is ready for clustering analysis
```

If verification fails, do not proceed with analysis. The verification script will identify specific data quality issues that must be resolved first.

For a quick status check, you can also run:

```bash
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
try:
    cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Players')
    print(f'Players in database: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
    cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PlayerArchetypeFeatures WHERE season = \"2024-25\"')
    print(f'Players with archetype features: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
    print(f'An error occurred: {e}')
    print('Please ensure the database has been initialized correctly.')
finally:
    conn.close()
"
```
**Expected Output**:
```
Players in database: 5025
Players with archetype features: 273
```

### 3. Launch the Analysis Tools

The project includes two primary user interfaces built with Streamlit.

**Launch the Complete Analysis Platform:**
```bash
# Start the main Streamlit dashboard
python run_interrogation_tool.py
```
This will open the main analysis platform at `http://localhost:8501`, where you can explore data, build lineups, and use the player acquisition tool.

**Launch the Model Governance Dashboard:**
```bash
# Start the governance dashboard
python run_governance_dashboard.py
```
This will open the governance dashboard at `http://localhost:8502`, which is used for validating and comparing different versions of the model coefficients.

### 4. Run the Complete Demo

To see an overview of all the project's capabilities from the command line, run the interactive demo:
```bash
# Interactive menu for all tools
python demo_implementation.py
```
