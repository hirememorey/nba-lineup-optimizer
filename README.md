# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

The project has recently undergone a complete architectural redesign based on first-principles reasoning and is now in the final stages of implementation.

## Current Status

    *   **Supercluster 1**: "Role Player Heavy" (87% Role Players)
*   **Quality Metrics**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Silhouette score: 0.381, Basketball interpretability: ‚úÖ

### Bayesian Modeling Implementation ‚úÖ (October 3, 2025)

The project has successfully implemented and deployed a production-ready Bayesian possession-level modeling pipeline:

*   **Data Preparation Pipeline**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Built comprehensive data transformation module that converts possession data into model-ready format with Z matrix calculations
*   **Production Model**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED** - Simplified Bayesian model with shared coefficients achieves perfect convergence (R-hat: 1.000, ESS: 2,791) in 85 seconds
*   **Model Architecture**: ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED** - Simplified model: E[y_i] = Œ≤_0 + Œ£_a Œ≤^off_a * Z^off_ia - Œ£_a Œ≤^def_a * Z^def_ia
*   **Scalability**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Model processes 96k possessions efficiently with excellent statistical properties
*   **Coefficient Analysis**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Generated interpretable coefficients for all 3 player archetypes

### Model Integration ‚úÖ (October 3, 2025)

The project has successfully integrated the production model with comprehensive validation tools:

*   **SimpleModelEvaluator**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Independent 7-parameter model evaluator using production coefficients
*   **Model Factory**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Unified interface for both model evaluators with fallback mechanisms
*   **Enhanced Model Dashboard**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - User-friendly interface with model switching and comparison
*   **Performance Optimization**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Lazy loading, caching, and performance monitoring
*   **Integration Test Suite**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive testing validates both systems work correctly
*   **UI Compatibility**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Seamless integration with existing analysis tools

### Key Architectural Decision

**Simplified Model Architecture**: The original research paper specified matchup-specific coefficients (36 parameters), but our data only contains 4 unique matchups. This created an impossible parameter-to-data ratio. The solution was a simplified model with shared coefficients across matchups (7 parameters), which is more robust and generalizable.

print(f"Predicted outcome: {result.predicted_outcome}")
print(f"Model type: {result.model_type}")

# Evaluate with fallback
result = ModelFactory.evaluate_lineup_with_fallback(lineup, "simple")
```
