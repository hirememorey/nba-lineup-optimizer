# NBA Lineup Optimizer

This project implements the methodology from the research paper "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. It uses a data-driven approach to NBA player acquisition and lineup optimization, prioritizing team **fit** over individual skill alone.

The project has recently undergone a complete architectural redesign based on first-principles reasoning and is now in the final stages of implementation.

## Current Status

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Bayesian Modeling Implemented - Scaling Issues Discovered**

The project has successfully completed player archetype generation, lineup supercluster analysis, and Bayesian modeling implementation. However, critical scaling issues have been discovered with the Stan model implementation that prevent production deployment on large datasets.

### What's Working ‚úÖ

*   **Complete Tooling Suite**:
    *   **Model Governance Dashboard**: For structured human validation of model coefficients.
    *   **Player Acquisition Tool**: To find the best 5th player for a 4-player core.
    *   **Interactive Analysis Platform**: A Streamlit UI with 6 analysis modes for deep exploration.
*   **Robust Data Pipeline**: A reliable and resumable data pipeline is in place.
*   **ModelEvaluator Foundation**: A "bulletproof" core library provides a single source of truth for all analysis.
*   **Complete Data Coverage**: All critical player tracking statistics are now fully populated:
    *   **Player Archetype Coverage**: 651 players (100% coverage with fallback assignments)
    *   **Possession Data**: 574,357 possessions with complete lineup data
    *   **Drive Statistics**: 100% coverage with proper variance
    *   **All Advanced Metrics**: 100% coverage for 48 canonical features
*   **Comprehensive Database**: 651 players with complete archetype assignments, 574k+ possessions, and all supporting data.

### Player Archetypes Generated ‚úÖ (October 3, 2025)

*   **Optimal K-Value Determination**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Used rigorous multi-metric evaluation to determine k=3 with PCA (80% variance) as optimal
*   **Feature Space Engineering**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implemented PCA-based dimensionality reduction (47 ‚Üí 13 components, 81.9% variance)
*   **Basketball-Meaningful Archetypes**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Generated three interpretable archetypes:
    *   **Big Men** (51 players, 18.7%): Valanƒçi≈´nas, Davis, Gobert, Giannis
    *   **Primary Ball Handlers** (86 players, 31.5%): LeBron, Curry, Durant, Harden  
    *   **Role Players** (136 players, 49.8%): Horford, Lopez, Batum, Holiday
*   **Quality Metrics**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Silhouette score: 0.235, Cluster balance: 0.375, Basketball interpretability: ‚úÖ
*   **Model Persistence**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All models and results saved for reproducibility

### Lineup Superclusters Generated ‚úÖ (October 3, 2025)

*   **Data Quality Resolution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Resolved critical data quality issue where 295 players were missing archetype assignments
*   **Fallback Assignment Strategy**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implemented basketball-meaningful fallback assignments for players with <1000 minutes
*   **Data Density Assessment**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Discovered 17 unique archetype lineups, adjusted clustering approach accordingly
*   **Qualitative Validation Framework**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Built comprehensive "sniff test" for supercluster validation
*   **Basketball-Meaningful Superclusters**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Generated two interpretable superclusters:
    *   **Supercluster 0**: "Balanced Lineups" (30% Big Men, 40% Ball Handlers, 30% Role Players)
    *   **Supercluster 1**: "Role Player Heavy" (87% Role Players)
*   **Quality Metrics**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Silhouette score: 0.381, Basketball interpretability: ‚úÖ

### Bayesian Modeling Implementation ‚úÖ (October 3, 2025)

The project has successfully implemented the core Bayesian possession-level modeling pipeline:

*   **Data Preparation Pipeline**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Built comprehensive data transformation module that converts possession data into model-ready format with Z matrix calculations
*   **PyMC Prototype Model**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Validated with excellent convergence (R-hat: 1.0000, ESS: 843+) - **RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**
*   **Stan Model Implementation**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Model implemented but has critical scaling limitations
*   **Model Validation**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - PyMC and Stan produce similar results on same data
*   **Scaling Issues**: ‚ùå **DISCOVERED** - Stan model hangs on samples >5k possessions
*   **Model Architecture**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Full implementation of research paper's Bayesian model: E[y_i] = Œ≤_0,m_i + Œ£_a Œ≤^off_a,m_i * Z^off_ia - Œ£_a Œ≤^def_a,m_i * Z^def_ia

### Next Steps

**CRITICAL**: Stan model scaling issues prevent production deployment. Use PyMC prototype for production until Stan scaling is resolved.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nba-lineup-optimizer.git
cd nba-lineup-optimizer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
```

### 2. Verify Database Status

**CRITICAL**: Always run the comprehensive database verification before proceeding with analysis.

```bash
# Run comprehensive database sanity verification
python verify_database_sanity.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üéâ ALL CRITICAL VERIFICATIONS PASSED
Database is ready for clustering analysis
```

If verification fails, do not proceed with analysis. The verification script will identify specific data quality issues that must be resolved first.

For a quick status check, you can also run:

```bash
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
try:
    cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Players')
    print(f'Players in database: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
    cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PlayerArchetypeFeatures WHERE season = \"2024-25\"')
    print(f'Players with archetype features: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}')
except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
    print(f'An error occurred: {e}')
    print('Please ensure the database has been initialized correctly.')
finally:
    conn.close()
"
```
**Expected Output**:
```
Players in database: 5025
Players with archetype features: 273
```

### 3. Launch the Analysis Tools

The project includes two primary user interfaces built with Streamlit.

**Launch the Complete Analysis Platform:**
```bash
# Start the main Streamlit dashboard
python run_interrogation_tool.py
```
This will open the main analysis platform at `http://localhost:8501`, where you can explore data, build lineups, and use the player acquisition tool.

**Launch the Model Governance Dashboard:**
```bash
# Start the governance dashboard
python run_governance_dashboard.py
```
This will open the governance dashboard at `http://localhost:8502`, which is used for validating and comparing different versions of the model coefficients.

### 4. Run the Complete Demo

To see an overview of all the project's capabilities from the command line, run the interactive demo:
```bash
# Interactive menu for all tools
python demo_implementation.py
```
