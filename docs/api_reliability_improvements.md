# API Reliability Improvements

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

## Overview

This document describes the architectural improvements made to address NBA API reliability issues that were causing data corruption in the player statistics pipeline.

## Problem Identified

During data integrity verification, we discovered that the `PlayerSeasonAdvancedStats` table showed a maximum of 44 games played for the 2024-25 season, when it should be 82 games for a full regular season. This indicated a critical data corruption issue.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to the `populate_player_season_stats.py` script, which uses a fragile architectural pattern:

1. **Per-Player API Calls**: The script loops through hundreds of players, making individual API calls to `playerdashboardbygeneralsplits` for each player
2. **Silent Failures**: When API calls timeout or fail due to rate limiting, the script continues without proper error handling
3. **Incomplete Data**: This results in partial data being written to the database, with some players having incorrect or missing statistics

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Persistent Caching Layer

**Implementation**: Added intelligent caching to `NBAStatsClient.make_request()`

- **Cache Location**: `.cache/` directory (auto-created)
- **Cache Duration**: 24 hours
- **Cache Key**: MD5 hash of endpoint + parameters
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates redundant network calls during development
  - Provides resilience against temporary API failures
  - Dramatically speeds up repeated operations

### 2. Increased Timeout

**Implementation**: Extended request timeout from 120 seconds to 300 seconds (5 minutes)

- **Rationale**: Bulk API calls (`leaguedashplayerstats`) require more time to complete
- **Impact**: Reduces timeout failures for large data requests

### 3. Reconnaissance Tools

**Implementation**: Created `debug_new_endpoint.py` script

- **Purpose**: Validate API endpoint compatibility before refactoring
- **Capabilities**:
  - Tests `leaguedashplayerstats` endpoint for both Base and Advanced measure types
  - Compares API response schema with database table schema
  - Validates data quality (e.g., games played counts)
  - Generates detailed compatibility reports

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `src/nba_stats/api/nba_stats_client.py`
  - Added `_get_cache_path()` method for cache file generation
  - Added `_read_from_cache()` method for cache retrieval
  - Added `_write_to_cache()` method for cache storage
  - Modified `make_request()` to implement caching logic
  - Increased timeout from 120 to 300 seconds

### Files Created

- `debug_new_endpoint.py` - API endpoint reconnaissance tool
- `.cache/` - Local cache directory (auto-created)

### Cache Strategy

```python
# Cache key generation
hasher = hashlib.md5()
hasher.update(json.dumps(params, sort_keys=True).encode('utf-8'))
hasher.update(endpoint.encode('utf-8'))
cache_path = CACHE_DIR / f"{hasher.hexdigest()}.json"
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Validation (In Progress)
1. Run `debug_new_endpoint.py` to validate `leaguedashplayerstats` compatibility
2. Confirm that bulk endpoint provides all required columns
3. Verify data quality (games played = 82 for full season)

### Phase 2: Refactoring (Planned)
1. Create decoupled fetcher function for `leaguedashplayerstats`
2. Refactor `populate_player_season_stats.py` to use bulk approach
3. Implement `Fetch -> Clear -> Populate` workflow
4. Add comprehensive data validation

### Phase 3: Verification (Planned)
1. Clear corrupted data from `PlayerSeasonAdvancedStats`
2. Repopulate using new bulk approach
3. Verify data integrity (max games played = 82)
4. Run full analysis pipeline

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Caching eliminates dependency on API availability
2. **Performance**: Subsequent runs are nearly instantaneous
3. **Development Speed**: Faster iteration during debugging and testing
4. **Data Quality**: Bulk endpoints provide more consistent, complete data
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation between data fetching and database operations

## Usage

### Running Reconnaissance
```bash
python debug_new_endpoint.py
```

### Cache Management
- Cache files are automatically managed
- To clear cache: `rm -rf .cache/`
- Cache expires after 24 hours automatically

### Monitoring
- Check logs for cache hit/miss information
- Monitor `.cache/` directory for file creation
- Verify data quality after population

## Conclusion

These improvements transform the data pipeline from a fragile, network-dependent system into a robust, cache-enabled architecture that can reliably populate complete, accurate player statistics for analysis.
