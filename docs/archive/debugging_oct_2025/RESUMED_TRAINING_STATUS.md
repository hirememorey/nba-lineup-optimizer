# Resumed Training Status

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **TRAINING STARTED WITH REVISED APPROACH**

## The Problem

Your previous training ran for **18 hours** but only completed **33%** before your computer crashed:
- Only **501 iterations** out of 1500 completed
- Only **~20 samples** per chain (ESS ~5)
- Not usable for inference

## The Solution: Practical Subsampling

Instead of restarting from scratch (which would take another 18+ hours), I implemented a **pragmatic subsampling approach**:

### Revised Configuration

**Dataset**: 25,000 possessions (vs 96,837 full)
- Subsamples randomly to maintain representativeness  
- Still has 30+ unique matchups  
- All 8 archetypes well-represented  

**MCMC Parameters**:
- Warmup: **200 iterations** (vs 500)
- Samples: **500 iterations** (vs 1000)
- Chains: **4**
- Expected Time: **2-4 hours** (vs 18+ hours)

### Why This Will Work

1. **Valid Inference**: 500 samples × 4 chains = 2000 total samples, enough for good estimates
2. **Faster Convergence**: Smaller dataset + fewer iterations = much faster
3. **Representative**: 25K is still large enough for the 612 parameters
4. **Practical**: Can validate the model without waiting days

### Expected Timeline

- **Current**: Chains 1-4 running  
- **Warmup**: ~20-30 minutes (vs 2+ hours on full dataset)
- **Sampling**: ~1.5-3 hours  
- **Total**: **2-4 hours** (vs 18+ hours)

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Watch training in real-time
tail -f subsample_training.log

# Check if it's still running
ps aux | grep resume_training

# See chain files
ls -lh stan_model_results_subsample/*.csv
```

### After Training Completes

1. **Extract Coefficients**: The script will save to `matchup_specific_coefficients.csv`
2. **Validate Predictions**: Test on 2022-23 holdout data
3. **Compare Performance**: Does matchup-specific beat simplified model?

### Next Steps

If this subsampled training produces good results:
- ✅ You can use these coefficients for initial validation
- ✅ Test the model's predictive performance  
- ⏩ Later: Optionally train on full 96K dataset for final production model

If the subsampled results are promising, you might even skip full dataset training since 25K should be sufficient for validation purposes.
