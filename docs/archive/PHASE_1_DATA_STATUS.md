**üöÄ READY FOR NEXT PHASE**: All data requirements for reproducing the original paper have been met. The system can now proceed with k=8 archetype clustering and Bayesian model implementation.

## Required Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
**üéØ PHASE 1 DATA COLLECTION COMPLETE** - All data requirements have been met!

### Next Implementation Phase
1. **Implement k=8 Archetype Clustering**
   - Use the 539 players with complete archetype features data
   - Implement exactly as described in the original paper
   - Validate clustering results against paper methodology

2. **Reproduce Bayesian Model from Paper**
   - Use 2022-23 data with k=8 archetypes
   - Implement exact Bayesian model (Equation 2.5)
   - Run MCMC sampling for 10,000 iterations

3. **Validate Against Known Examples**
   - Test Lakers, Pacers, and Suns examples from paper
   - Verify model produces expected results
   - Document validation outcomes

4. **Scale to Current Data**
   - Apply validated methodology to 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons
   - Test model consistency across seasons
   - Prepare for production integration
