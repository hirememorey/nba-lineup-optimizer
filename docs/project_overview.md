# Project Overview: Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" project, based on the foundational research paper by Brill, Hughes, and Waldbaum. The goal of this project is to create a sophisticated system for evaluating NBA player acquisitions that prioritizes team **fit** over individual skill alone.

## Core Concepts

The model is built on the premise that a player's value is deeply contextual. It depends not only on their talent but also on their specific role and how that role interacts with the roles of their teammates and opponents.

### 1. Player Archetypes ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

To capture a player's on-court role, the system categorizes every player into one of **three distinct archetypes** based on rigorous data analysis. These are not traditional positions (PG, SG) but are instead based on playstyle, determined using PCA-based feature engineering and multi-metric clustering evaluation.

- **How it Works**: Players are clustered using K-means algorithm on PCA-transformed features derived from 48 advanced statistics. The analysis revealed that k=3 with PCA (80% variance) provides optimal basketball-meaningful separation.

- **The 3 Implemented Archetypes**:
  1. **Big Men** (51 players, 18.7%): High height, wingspan, frontcourt presence, paint touches
     - *Examples*: Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert, Giannis Antetokounmpo
  2. **Primary Ball Handlers** (86 players, 31.5%): High usage, driving ability, playmaking skills
     - *Examples*: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden
  3. **Role Players** (136 players, 49.8%): Balanced contributors, catch-and-shoot ability, defensive presence
     - *Examples*: Al Horford, Brook Lopez, Nicolas Batum, Jrue Holiday

### 2. Lineup Superclusters ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

Just as individual players have archetypes, five-player lineups have collective strategies. The model identifies **two "superclusters"** to represent the tactical style of a lineup (adjusted from the paper's six based on data density constraints).

- **How it Works**: Lineups are clustered using K-means algorithm on weighted average statistics derived from player archetype compositions. The analysis revealed that k=2 provides optimal basketball-meaningful separation given the available data.

- **The 2 Implemented Superclusters**:
  1. **Supercluster 0**: "Balanced Lineups" (30% Big Men, 40% Ball Handlers, 30% Role Players)
  2. **Supercluster 1**: "Role Player Heavy" (87% Role Players)

### 3. Bayesian Possession-Level Modeling ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

The core analytical engine that estimates the value of different player combinations in specific matchups.

- **How it Works**: Uses Bayesian regression to model possession outcomes based on the interaction between offensive and defensive lineup superclusters and individual player skills (DARKO ratings).

- **Model Specification**:
  ```
  E[y_i] = Œ≤_0,m_i + Œ£_a Œ≤^off_a,m_i * Z^off_ia - Œ£_a Œ≤^def_a,m_i * Z^def_ia
  ```
  Where:
  - `y_i` is the expected net points for possession i
  - `m_i` is the matchup (offensive supercluster, defensive supercluster)
  - `a` is the archetype (Big Men, Primary Ball Handlers, Role Players)
  - `Z^off_ia` and `Z^def_ia` are aggregated skill ratings by archetype
  - `Œ≤` coefficients are estimated using MCMC sampling

- **Implementation Status**:
  - ‚úÖ Data preparation pipeline completed
  - ‚úÖ PyMC prototype model validated (excellent convergence)
  - ‚úÖ Statistical scaling analysis completed
  - üîÑ Production Stan model ready for implementation

### 4. Player Acquisition and Lineup Valuation

The model estimates a player's impact based on their offensive and defensive skill (using the DARKO metric), but critically, it weights this skill based on the full context of the possession:
- The player's own **archetype**.
- The **supercluster** of their offensive lineup.
- The **supercluster** of the opposing defensive lineup.

This approach allows the model to capture nuanced interactions. For example, it can recognize that adding another "Playmaking, Initiating Guard" to a lineup already featuring a ball-dominant "Offensive Juggernaut" may yield diminishing returns.

### 4. Player Acquisition and Lineup Valuation

The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for player acquisition.

- **Lineup Value**: A lineup's overall value is calculated by simulating its performance (both on offense and defense) against a baseline of the previous season's playoff teams. This ensures that lineup construction is optimized for high-level competition.
- **Acquisition Tool**: The system can take a core of four players and search through a list of available free agents to find the fifth player who maximizes the new lineup's projected value, taking both skill and team fit into account.

This methodology provides a powerful, data-driven framework for roster construction that moves beyond simple player rankings and embraces the complex, interactive nature of basketball.

## Data Integrity and Reconciliation

The project includes a comprehensive data reconciliation system to ensure 100% coverage of player salary and skill data:

- **Enhanced Reconciliation Tool**: Interactive system that handles both name mapping and player creation
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Intelligent suggestions for resolving name discrepancies
- **NBA API Integration**: Automatic creation of missing players via official NBA data
- **Persistent Mapping**: Reusable mapping file for consistent data across seasons
