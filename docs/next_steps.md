# Next Steps for 2024-25 Season Analysis

**Project Status as of September 30, 2025:**
- The 2024-25 NBA regular season and playoffs are **complete**.
- All data for this season *should* be available via the `stats.nba.com` API.
- **Data pipeline is complete and verified** - ready for analysis phase.

This document outlines the immediate, high-priority tasks required to prepare the project for the analysis of the 2024-25 NBA season.

**`[COMPLETED]`** ~~## Task 1: Database Migration (Critical Blocker)~~

- **Status**: ✅ Done.
- **Objective**: Alter the tables to include `player_id` and `season_id` columns to enable proper data storage and querying.
- **Implementation**: The `src/nba_stats/scripts/migrate_db.py` script now safely handles this, archiving old tables if they exist.

**`[COMPLETED]`** ~~## Task 2: Update Data Population Scripts~~

- **Status**: ✅ Done.
- **Objective**: Modify the population scripts to load the 2024-25 CSV data into the new table structures.
- **Implementation**:
    - `populate_salaries.py` now reads directly from `data/player_salaries_2024-25.csv`.
    - `populate_player_skill.py` now reads directly from `data/darko_dpm_2024-25.csv`.

**`[COMPLETED]`** ~~### Task 3: Debug and Fix Possession Data Population~~

- **Status**: ✅ **Done.**
- **Objective**: Populate the `Possessions` table with granular, play-by-play data for the entire season by running `src/nba_stats/scripts/populate_possessions.py`.
- **Resolution**: The script was failing due to a breaking change in the `nba_api` library, which removed the `.game_summary` attribute used to fetch team IDs. The script was refactored to query the local `Games` table for the `home_team_id` and `away_team_id` and pass them directly to the processing function, resolving the issue. After this initial fix, the script was further hardened to handle anomalous substitution data, network timeouts, and non-atomic writes, making it fully robust.

**`[COMPLETED]`** ~~### Task 4: Run Full Data Pipeline for 2024-25~~

- **Status**: ✅ **Done.**
- **Objective**: Ensure all required data for the 2024-25 season is present in the database.
- **Resolution**: The full pipeline was executed successfully after significant architectural hardening. The `Possessions` table is now fully populated with all 1,230 games.

**`[COMPLETED]`** ~~### Task 5: Data Integrity Verification~~

- **Status**: ✅ **Done.**
- **Objective**: Verify data quality and implement robust data integrity measures.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added foreign key enforcement to all database connections
  - Created comprehensive verification scripts (`verify_data_integrity.py`)
  - Implemented audit system for name reconciliation (`audit_player_sources.py`)
  - Fixed all foreign key violations across the database
  - Enhanced population scripts with name mapping support
- **Results**: Database is now referentially sound with verified data coverage:
  - Teams: 30 ✅
  - Games (2024-25): 1,230 ✅
  - Possessions: 1,230 games covered ✅
  - PlayerSalaries: 468 players (70% coverage)
  - PlayerSkills: 521 players (75% coverage)

### Task 6: Run the Analysis

- **Status**: ⏳ READY TO PROCEED
- **Objective**: Generate the 2024-25 player archetypes, lineup superclusters, and Bayesian model results.
- **Instructions**: Follow the guide in `docs/running_the_analysis.md`.
- **Note**: The database is now verified and ready for analysis with the current data coverage.
