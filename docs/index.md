# Welcome to the NBA Player Acquisition Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Algorithmic NBA Player Acquisition" project. The goal of this project is to provide a data-driven framework for evaluating NBA players based not just on their individual skill, but on how well they **fit** within different team structures and strategies.

## Documentation Hub

This `docs` directory is the central source of truth for understanding and working with this project.
