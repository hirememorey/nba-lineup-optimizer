# NBA Lineup Optimizer - Current Status

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: üöÄ **BAYESIAN MODEL IMPLEMENTATION** - Core Data Pipeline Repaired. Test Harness Built.

## Executive Summary

**üöÄ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: DATA PIPELINE VALIDATED & TEST HARNESS BUILT** - A critical, non-obvious bug in the `populate_lineup_stats.py` script has been identified and fixed, and the `PlayerLineupStats` table is now fully and correctly populated with 2022-23 season data. Furthermore, a "Feature Feasibility Study" has confirmed 100% of the required features for lineup superclustering are present.

To prevent future data corruption, we have pivoted to a **test-driven development approach**. A full integration test harness (`tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py`) has been built. This harness uses a hand-crafted micro-dataset and a corresponding "answer key" to validate the entire data transformation pipeline, from raw lineups to the final Stan model input.

**Critical Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ **`populate_lineup_stats.py` Repaired**: A subtle bug in the `_to_snake_case` utility that caused silent data insertion failures has been fixed and validated with unit tests.
- ‚úÖ **`PlayerLineupStats` Populated**: The table now contains 4,968 records of complete lineup data for the 2022-23 season.
- ‚úÖ **Feature Feasibility Confirmed**: All 18 required features for superclustering are confirmed to exist in the populated table.
- ‚úÖ **Integration Test Harness Built**: `tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py`, along with ground-truth data, provides a robust framework for validating the next implementation phase.

**Next Phase**: Incrementally implement the lineup supercluster and Bayesian data preparation scripts, using the new integration test harness to drive development and ensure correctness at every step.

## üöÄ Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **Phase 0: Data Lineage & Feasibility - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Repair the foundational data pipeline and de-risk the supercluster implementation.

**Tasks Completed:**
- **`populate_lineup_stats.py` Debugging**:
    - Identified and fixed a critical bug in the `_to_snake_case` header conversion function.
    - Implemented a schema reconnaissance mode (`--recon`) to proactively identify API inconsistencies.
    - Created and used a temporary unit test (`tests/test_utils.py`) to validate the fix in isolation.
- **Data Population**:
    - Successfully cleared and populated the `PlayerLineupStats` table for the `2022-23` season.
    - Verified the final record count (4,968) to confirm a complete data load.
- **Feature Feasibility Study**:
    - Manually compared the 18 features required by the source paper against the schema of the populated `PlayerLineupStats` table.
    - **Result**: Confirmed a 100% match. All necessary data is present.

### üéØ **Phase 1: Build Integration Test Harness - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Build a test-driven framework to prevent silent data corruption in the multi-step data transformation pipeline.

**Key Files Created**:
- `tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py`: The core integration test script. It loads a ground-truth input, runs it through the pipeline (currently using placeholder functions), and asserts the final output matches a pre-defined "answer key".
- `tests/ground_truth_test_lineups.csv`: A hand-crafted micro-dataset of input lineups.
- `tests/ground_truth_stan_input.csv`: A hand-crafted "answer key" representing the exact, correct output the pipeline should produce.

**Current Status**: The test harness is **live and passing** using placeholder functions, confirming the test framework itself is sound.

### ‚è≥ **Phase 2: Bayesian Model Implementation - IN PROGRESS**

**Current Task**: Incrementally build the data processing pipeline using the test harness.

**Methodology: "Make the Test Pass"**
The next phase of development will be driven entirely by the integration test.
1.  **Replace Dummy Functions**: One by one, the placeholder functions in `tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py` will be replaced with calls to the *actual* data processing scripts.
2.  **Run and Observe Failure**: The test will initially fail, highlighting the discrepancies between the script's output and the ground-truth "answer key".
3.  **Debug and Refactor**: The script will be debugged and refactored specifically to make the test pass for the micro-dataset.
4.  **Validate at Scale**: Only once the test is passing with the real script will that component be considered complete and ready for a full run.

**Next Steps**:
1.  **[PRIORITY]** Implement `generate_lineup_superclusters.py` and integrate it into the test harness.
2.  Implement `bayesian_data_prep.py` and integrate it into the test harness.
3.  Build the validation harness (`validate_model.py`) to test the final model's output against the paper's examples.
4.  Create the final training script (`train_bayesian_model.py`) to scale the prototype to all matchups.

### üìÅ **Key Files Created**

**Bayesian Model Implementation Scripts:**
- `semantic_prototype.py`: Solves core data transformations in isolation.
- `verify_semantic_data.py`: Profiles the entire dataset for quality and statistical issues.
- `bayesian_data_prep.py`: Generates the final, model-ready dataset.
- `bayesian_model_k8.stan`: Defines the statistical model for `cmdstanpy`.
- `bayesian_model_prototype.py`: Compiles and tests the Stan model on a sample.

**Data Outputs:**
- `possessions_k8_prepared.csv`: The full, clean dataset for the model.
- `stratified_sample_10k.csv`: A smaller sample for rapid prototyping.
- `data_sanity_check.json`: A report detailing data completeness issues.
- `statistical_profile.json`: A report on the statistical properties of the clean data.

### üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

**Database Location**: `src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db`
**Archetype System**: 8 clusters (0-7) validated against paper examples
**Data Sources**: NBA Stats API, DARKO ratings, Kaggle salary data
**Validation Method**: "Sniff test" against key players (LeBron, Jokic, etc.)

## üéØ Case Study Archive Implementation (LEGACY APPROACH)

### **Why This Approach is Necessary**

Based on post-mortem analysis of previous validation attempts, we identified critical failures:
- **Oversimplification**: Previous approaches tried to find single causes for complex basketball failures
- **Missing Context**: Ignored non-basketball factors (chemistry, personality, expectations)
- **Binary Thinking**: Treated success/failure as absolute rather than relative to expectations
- **Lack of Historical Grounding**: Built theoretical models without real NBA validation

### **Case Study Archive Strategy**

**Core Philosophy**: Embrace basketball's complexity and unpredictability by building a historical database of real NBA cases to identify patterns, not definitive answers.

**Implementation Plan**:

#### **Phase 1: Historical Database (2017-2025)**
- **Data Sources**: Major trades, free agent signings, significant lineup changes
- **Temporal Scope**: 8+ years of data for comprehensive trend analysis
- **Case Selection**: 20-30 significant cases with clear expectations and outcomes
- **Player Focus**: 2-3 key players per case (the "core" of the change)

#### **Phase 2: Betting Market-Based Scoring**
- **Hype Score (1-10)**: Derived from betting market movements (win totals, championship odds)
- **Outcome Score (1-10)**: Based on actual team performance vs. pre-season expectations
- **Expectation Gap**: Hype Score - Outcome Score (positive = underperformed)

#### **Phase 3: Pattern Recognition Engine**
- **Observable Factors**: Role redundancy, skill mismatches, system fit, context factors
- **Correlation Analysis**: Look for statistical patterns across multiple cases
- **Threshold-Based**: Use percentile thresholds (e.g., top 20% usage rate = "high usage")
- **Historical Validation**: Every pattern must be backed by at least 3-5 historical cases

#### **Phase 4: Glass Box Advisor Integration**
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Technical Fit Score based on measurable factors
- **Qualitative Risk Flags**: Grounded in historical patterns, not arbitrary warnings
- **Transparent Reporting**: Clear separation of what can be measured vs. what cannot

### **Key Assumptions**

1. **Basketball is Unpredictable**: Accept that some combinations just don't work for unexplainable reasons
2. **Expectations Matter**: Success/failure is relative to expectations, not absolute
3. **Patterns Over Predictions**: Focus on identifying recurring patterns, not predicting specific outcomes
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Distinguish measurable factors from unmeasurable ones
