# NBA Lineup Optimizer - Current Status

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: üöÄ **SUPERCLUSTER PIPELINE VALIDATED & BUILT** - Data Foundation Rebuilt.

## Executive Summary

**üöÄ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: DATA FOUNDATION REBUILT & SUPERCLUSTER PIPELINE VALIDATED** - A critical data quality disaster in the `PlayerLineupStats` table has been identified and resolved through a "profile-first" data archaeology approach. The project has successfully reconstructed a reliable 18-feature set from complete data, built a robust supercluster generation pipeline (`generate_lineup_superclusters.py`) using `RobustScaler` and K-Means, and validated the entire process end-to-end with a refactored test harness.

The core data integrity risks have been mitigated, and the project is now unblocked for the final modeling phase.

**Critical Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ **Data Quality Disaster Averted**: A comprehensive profiling of the `PlayerLineupStats` table revealed that over 50% of columns were unusable due to `NULL` values. This discovery prevented a catastrophic model failure.
- ‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Feature Set**: A new, reliable set of 18 features for clustering has been constructed from columns that were verified to be 100% complete.
- ‚úÖ **Robust Scaling Implemented**: Statistical analysis confirmed the presence of significant outliers, and `RobustScaler` was chosen and implemented to create a more reliable clustering foundation.
- ‚úÖ **Supercluster Pipeline Built**: The `generate_lineup_superclusters.py` script is now a production-ready, validated tool that automates the entire process from data loading to model saving.
- ‚úÖ **Test Harness Refactored**: The integration test is now a modular, two-step process that provides a clear validation contract for each part of the pipeline.

**Next Phase**: With a high-integrity data pipeline now in place, the immediate next step is to train the Bayesian model using the newly generated supercluster data.

## üöÄ Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **Phase 0: "Validate the Validator" - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Refactor the test harness to create a modular, unambiguous validation process.
**Tasks Completed:**
- The single integration test in `tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py` was split into two distinct tests: `test_supercluster_generation` and `test_bayesian_data_preparation`.
- A new intermediate ground-truth file was created to serve as an explicit contract between the two pipeline stages, making the process easier to debug and validate.

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Data Archaeology & Reconstruction - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Profile the source data to build an evidence-based feature set.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **Data Profiling**: A comprehensive statistical analysis of the `PlayerLineupStats` table was performed, revealing that 50 of 86 columns were over 58% `NULL`.
- **Feature Reconstruction**: Based on the profiling, a new set of 18 features was selected from the 36 columns that were verified to be 100% complete. This data-driven feature set is now the source of truth for clustering.

### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Prototyping and De-risking - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Validate the clustering methodology in an isolated environment before implementation.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **Statistical Reconnaissance**: A visual analysis of the 18 validated features confirmed the presence of significant outliers, validating the pre-mortem hypothesis.
- **Scaler Selection**: `RobustScaler` was programmatically confirmed as the correct, outlier-resistant scaling method.
- **Logic Prototyping**: The full K-Means (k=6) clustering logic was prototyped on the robustly scaled data, providing a proven blueprint for implementation.

### ‚úÖ **Phase 3: Hardened Implementation - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Port the validated, prototype-driven logic into production scripts.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **`generate_lineup_superclusters.py`**: The script was implemented with the full, validated pipeline: loading data, selecting the 18 features, applying `RobustScaler`, performing K-Means clustering, and saving the clustered data and trained models.
- **`bayesian_data_prep.py`**: A placeholder script was created to satisfy the test harness for the final data preparation step.
- **Final Validation**: The full, refactored test suite was run successfully, providing end-to-end confirmation that the pipeline is working as expected.

### ‚è≥ **Phase 4: Bayesian Model Training - IN PROGRESS**

**Current Task**: Train the Bayesian model on the high-quality, superclustered data.

**Next Steps**:
1.  **[PRIORITY]** Implement the full logic for `bayesian_data_prep.py`, which needs to merge the supercluster output with possession-level data to create the final `matchup_id`.
2.  Use the prepared data to train the Stan model in `train_bayesian_model.py`.
3.  Validate the trained model's coefficients and test its predictions against the source paper's examples (Lakers, Pacers, Suns) using `validate_model.py`.
