# NBA Lineup Optimizer - Current Status

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: âœ… **BAYESIAN DATA PREP COMPLETED; ARTIFACTS READY** â€” Supercluster artifacts regenerated with dynamic feature fallback.

## Executive Summary

**Update** â€” Fixed lineup ingestion to use the union of all fetched keys (instead of the first recordâ€™s keys) when inserting into `PlayerLineupStats`. Re-populated 2022â€‘23 lineup stats (4,968 rows). Advanced fields such as `off_rating`, `def_rating`, `ts_pct`, `pace`, `efg_pct`, `ast_pct`, `ast_to`, `oreb_pct`, `dreb_pct`, `reb_pct`, and `tm_tov_pct` are now present. Four scoring share fields are still absent from the final insert column set: `pct_fga_2pt`, `pct_fga_3pt`, `pct_pts_2pt_mr`, `pct_pts_3pt`. After regeneration, superclusters still fell back to highâ€‘coverage features due to those share fields being incomplete across rows.

**Critical Achievements**:
- âœ… **Data Quality Disaster Averted**: A comprehensive profiling of the `PlayerLineupStats` table revealed that over 50% of columns were unusable due to `NULL` values. This discovery prevented a catastrophic model failure.
- âœ… **Evidence-Based Feature Set**: A new, reliable set of 18 features for clustering has been constructed from columns that were verified to be 100% complete.
- âœ… **Robust Scaling Implemented**: Statistical analysis confirmed the presence of significant outliers, and `RobustScaler` was chosen and implemented to create a more reliable clustering foundation.
- âœ… **Supercluster Pipeline Built**: The `generate_lineup_superclusters.py` script is now a production-ready, validated tool that automates the entire process from data loading to model saving.
- âœ… **Test Harness Refactored**: The integration test is now a modular, two-step process that provides a clear validation contract for each part of the pipeline.

**Next Phase**: Either (a) populate the remaining scoring share fields and regenerate superclusters with the full validated feature set, or (b) proceed to train the Bayesian model using the current fallback superclusters, then circle back to upgrade clustering quality.

## ðŸš€ Current Implementation Status

### âœ… **Phase 0: "Validate the Validator" - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Refactor the test harness to create a modular, unambiguous validation process.
**Tasks Completed:**
- The single integration test in `tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py` was split into two distinct tests: `test_supercluster_generation` and `test_bayesian_data_preparation`.
- A new intermediate ground-truth file was created to serve as an explicit contract between the two pipeline stages, making the process easier to debug and validate.

### âœ… **Phase 1: Data Archaeology & Reconstruction - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Profile the source data to build an evidence-based feature set.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **Data Profiling**: A comprehensive statistical analysis of the `PlayerLineupStats` table was performed, revealing that 50 of 86 columns were over 58% `NULL`.
- **Feature Reconstruction**: Based on the profiling, a new set of 18 features was selected from the 36 columns that were verified to be 100% complete. This data-driven feature set is now the source of truth for clustering.

### âœ… **Phase 2: Prototyping and De-risking - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Validate the clustering methodology in an isolated environment before implementation.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **Statistical Reconnaissance**: A visual analysis of the 18 validated features confirmed the presence of significant outliers, validating the pre-mortem hypothesis.
- **Scaler Selection**: `RobustScaler` was programmatically confirmed as the correct, outlier-resistant scaling method.
- **Logic Prototyping**: The full K-Means (k=6) clustering logic was prototyped on the robustly scaled data, providing a proven blueprint for implementation.

### âœ… **Phase 3: Hardened Implementation - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Port the validated, prototype-driven logic into production scripts.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **`generate_lineup_superclusters.py`**: The script was implemented with the full, validated pipeline: loading data, selecting the 18 features, applying `RobustScaler`, performing K-Means clustering, and saving the clustered data and trained models.
- **`bayesian_data_prep.py`**: A placeholder script was created to satisfy the test harness for the final data preparation step.
- **Final Validation**: The full, refactored test suite was run successfully, providing end-to-end confirmation that the pipeline is working as expected.

### âœ… **Phase 4: Bayesian Model Training â€” DATA PREP COMPLETE**

**Artifacts Produced**:
- `production_bayesian_data.csv` (627,969 rows)
- `stratified_sample_10k.csv` (10,000 rows)
- `trained_models/robust_scaler.joblib` (regenerated)
- `trained_models/kmeans_model.joblib` (regenerated)
- `lineup_supercluster_results/lineup_features_with_superclusters.csv` (regenerated)
- `lineup_supercluster_results/supercluster_assignments.json` (present)

**Sanity Checks**:
- Database verification: PASS (all layers)
- Output CSVs: required columns present, outcomes âˆˆ {0,1,2,3}, no NaNs/Inf

**Next Steps**:
1. Fill missing scoring share fields in `PlayerLineupStats`: `pct_fga_2pt`, `pct_fga_3pt`, `pct_pts_2pt_mr`, `pct_pts_3pt` (source: lineup Scoring split from the same API endpoint).
2. Re-run `src/nba_stats/scripts/generate_lineup_superclusters.py` and confirm the 18 validated features are used without fallback.
3. Train the Stan model with `production_bayesian_data.csv` via `train_bayesian_model.py`.
4. Validate coefficients against the paperâ€™s examples using `validate_model.py` (Lakers, Pacers, Suns).
