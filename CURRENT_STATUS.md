# NBA Lineup Optimizer - Current Status

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **MODEL TRAINED; READY FOR PAPER VALIDATION** — Training completed successfully with strong convergence. Proceed to validate against the paper's case studies.

## Executive Summary

**Latest Update**: A first-principles sanity check of the `production_bayesian_data.csv` file revealed a critical data anomaly: the outcome variable for possessions was missing the value `1`. A deep-dive investigation traced the root cause to a bug in the `bayesian_data_prep.py` script, where made free throws were not being correctly identified. This logic has been **fixed and verified**. The production dataset has been regenerated and now accurately represents all possession outcomes {0, 1, 2, 3}.

**The project is now fully unblocked and ready for the final validation phase.** Data artifacts were validated, the Stan model has been trained, and coefficients are available for downstream validation.

**Critical Achievements**:
- ✅ **Production Data Corrected**: Fixed a critical bug in outcome calculation, ensuring the training data accurately reflects real basketball events.
- ✅ **Full Data Validation**: The `production_bayesian_data.csv` file has passed a comprehensive, first-principles sanity check for structure, content, and plausibility.
- ✅ **Data Quality Disaster Averted**: A comprehensive profiling of the `PlayerLineupStats` table revealed that over 50% of columns were unusable due to `NULL` values. This discovery prevented a catastrophic model failure.
- ✅ **Evidence-Based Feature Set**: A new, reliable set of 18 features for clustering has been constructed from columns that were verified to be 100% complete.
- ✅ **Robust Scaling Implemented**: Statistical analysis confirmed the presence of significant outliers, and `RobustScaler` was chosen and implemented to create a more reliable clustering foundation.

**Next Phase**: Implement and run the paper-case validation (Lakers, Pacers, Suns) using the trained coefficients.

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **Phase 0: "Validate the Validator" - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Refactor the test harness to create a modular, unambiguous validation process.
**Tasks Completed:**
- The single integration test in `tests/test_bayesian_pipeline_integrity.py` was split into two distinct tests: `test_supercluster_generation` and `test_bayesian_data_preparation`.
- A new intermediate ground-truth file was created to serve as an explicit contract between the two pipeline stages, making the process easier to debug and validate.

### ✅ **Phase 1: Data Archaeology & Reconstruction - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Profile the source data to build an evidence-based feature set.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **Data Profiling**: A comprehensive statistical analysis of the `PlayerLineupStats` table was performed, revealing that 50 of 86 columns were over 58% `NULL`.
- **Feature Reconstruction**: Based on the profiling, a new set of 18 features was selected from the 36 columns that were verified to be 100% complete. This data-driven feature set is now the source of truth for clustering.

### ✅ **Phase 2: Prototyping and De-risking - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Validate the clustering methodology in an isolated environment before implementation.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **Statistical Reconnaissance**: A visual analysis of the 18 validated features confirmed the presence of significant outliers, validating the pre-mortem hypothesis.
- **Scaler Selection**: `RobustScaler` was programmatically confirmed as the correct, outlier-resistant scaling method.
- **Logic Prototyping**: The full K-Means (k=6) clustering logic was prototyped on the robustly scaled data, providing a proven blueprint for implementation.

### ✅ **Phase 3: Hardened Implementation - COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Port the validated, prototype-driven logic into production scripts.
**Tasks Completed:**
- **`generate_lineup_superclusters.py`**: The script was implemented with the full, validated pipeline: loading data, selecting the 18 features, applying `RobustScaler`, performing K-Means clustering, and saving the clustered data and trained models.
- **`bayesian_data_prep.py`**: A placeholder script was created to satisfy the test harness for the final data preparation step.
- **Final Validation**: The full, refactored test suite was run successfully, providing end-to-end confirmation that the pipeline is working as expected.

### ✅ **Phase 4: Bayesian Model Training — COMPLETE**

**Artifacts Produced**:
- `production_bayesian_data.csv` (627,969 rows)
- `stratified_sample_10k.csv` (10,000 rows)
- `model_coefficients.csv` (posterior means)
- `stan_model_report.txt` (training summary)
- `stan_model_results/` (per-chain CSVs and summaries)
- `trained_models/robust_scaler.joblib`
- `trained_models/kmeans_model.joblib`
- `lineup_supercluster_results/lineup_features_with_superclusters.csv`
- `lineup_supercluster_results/supercluster_assignments.json`

**Training Diagnostics**:
- Max R-hat: 1.00099
- Min ESS: 2,689.94
- Divergent transitions: 0

**Next Steps**:
1.  Implement `validate_paper_cases.py` (or extend `validate_model.py`) to load `model_coefficients.csv` and evaluate the three paper case studies.
2.  Produce a short `model_validation_report.json` indicating PASS/FAIL for Lakers, Pacers, Suns and brief notes.

Suggested skeleton:
```
python3 validate_model.py --coefficients model_coefficients.csv --season 2022-23 \
  --cases lakers pacers suns --output model_validation_report.json
```
