- ✅ Created basketball-intuitive fit explanations
- ✅ Added name-based player search with instant analysis
- ✅ Built team roster analysis with position balance
- ✅ Integrated free agent recommendations with team-specific filtering

**Next Phase**: The system is ready for real-world examples and case studies to demonstrate player-team fit scenarios.

## Key Architectural Decision

**Simplified Model Architecture**: The original research paper specified matchup-specific coefficients (36 parameters), but our data only contains 4 unique matchups. This created an impossible parameter-to-data ratio. The solution was a simplified model with shared coefficients across matchups (7 parameters), which is more robust and generalizable.

## Current Model Performance

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| R-hat | 1.000 | ✅ Perfect |
| ESS | 2,791 | ✅ Excellent |
| Divergent Transitions | 0 | ✅ Stable |
| Training Time | 85 seconds | ✅ Fast |
| Parameters | 7 | ✅ Optimal |

## Key Insights for New Developers

### What We Learned
1. **Model complexity must match data density** - Don't over-parameterize
2. **Statistical convergence ≠ semantic validity** - Always validate coefficients make sense
3. **Simpler is often better** - The simplified model is more robust than the complex one
4. **Data quality is everything** - 100% coverage was essential for success

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Don't assume the paper's model will work** - Adapt to your data constraints
2. **Don't ignore convergence warnings** - "Borderline" convergence usually means failure
3. **Don't skip semantic validation** - Statistical success doesn't guarantee meaningful results
4. **Don't rush to complex solutions** - Start simple and add complexity only when needed
