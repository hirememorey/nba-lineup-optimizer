        "   - **Result**: Basic team request, Basic player request, League player stats (Base) now pass\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **FTPCT Metric Failure** ✅\n",
        "   - **Problem**: Data fetcher was calling wrong method (`get_players_with_stats` instead of raw API response)\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Created `get_league_player_base_stats()` method and updated data fetcher to use it\n",
        "   - **Result**: FTPCT now successfully extracts 569 player records\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **FTr Metric Failure** ✅\n",
        "   - **Problem**: Wrong column mapping (`FTA_PG` from advanced stats instead of `FTA` from base stats)\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Updated `definitive_metric_mapping.py` to use correct endpoint and column\n",
        "   - **Result**: FTr now successfully extracts 569 player records\n",

        "### Final Results\n",
        "- **Smoke Test**: 23/25 tests passed (92% success rate)\n",

        "3. **Metric mappings** must be verified against actual API column names\n",
