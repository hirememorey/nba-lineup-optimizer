# Phase 2 Readiness Audit Report

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ **NOT READY FOR PHASE 2** - Critical gaps identified

## Executive Summary

Despite documentation claiming "historical data collection complete" with 1,770,051 possessions ready for multi-season training, a thorough sanity check reveals critical gaps that **prevent Phase 2 implementation**:

1. **Multi-season Bayesian data file only contains 13.1% of expected data** (231K vs 1.77M possessions)
2. **Only 3 unique matchups** present (expected: 36 for 6×6 supercluster system)
3. **Missing 2022-23 archetype CSV** file (though database table exists)
4. **Archetype 0 has zero usage** across all possessions
5. **No production-ready script** exists to generate proper multi-season data

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Data Quantity Gap (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: `multi_season_bayesian_data.csv` contains only **231,310 rows** instead of the expected **~1,770,000 possessions**.

**Evidence**:
- File created: October 26, 2025 at 16:39
- Expected: 621,523 + 538,444 + 610,084 = 1,770,051 possessions
- Actual: 231,310 rows
- **Shortfall: 86.9%** (1,538,741 missing possessions)

**Root Cause**: Unknown - no script found that generates this file. The file appears to be either manually created or from an incomplete/abandoned attempt.

**Impact**: **BLOCKER** - Cannot train multi-season model with such incomplete data.

---

### 2. Matchup Diversity Crisis (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: The multi-season data has only **3 unique matchups** instead of the expected **36**.

**Expected Structure**:
- 6 lineup superclusters × 6 lineup superclusters = 36 possible matchups

**Actual Structure**:
- Only 3 matchups: `['0_vs_0', '0_vs_5', '5_vs_0']`
- This suggests the supercluster mapping is almost completely broken

**Evidence from Data**:
```
Matchup diversity: 3 unique matchups
Expected: 36 (6x6 superclusters)
Matchups present: ['0_vs_0', '0_vs_5', '5_vs_0']
```

**Impact**: **BLOCKER** - The model cannot learn proper archetype interactions with only 3 matchups. The training data lacks the diversity needed for the Bayesian model to capture different lineup vs lineup dynamics.

---

### 3. Archetype 0 Completely Unused (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Archetype 0 has **zero non-zero aggregations** across all 231,310 possessions.

**Evidence**:
```
Archetype 0 offense: 0 non-zero aggregations (0.0%)
Archetype 1 offense: 170,245 rows (73.6%)
Archetype 2 offense: 74,690 rows (32.3%)
...
```

**Possible Root Causes**:
1. Archetype assignments skip 0 (using 1-8 instead of 0-7)
2. Index mapping error in Z-matrix construction
3. No players actually assigned to archetype 0

**Impact**: **BLOCKER** - The 8-archetype model (k=8) cannot work with only 7 effective archetypes. Either the archetype assignment or the Z-matrix construction is broken.

---

### 4. Missing 2022-23 Archetype CSV File

**Issue**: File `player_archetypes_k8_2022_23.csv` does not exist, but the database table `PlayerArchetypeFeatures_2022_23` does exist with 539 rows.

**Evidence**:
- Files present:
  - ✅ `player_archetypes_k8_2018-19.csv` (234 players)
  - ✅ `player_archetypes_k8_2020-21.csv` (229 players)
  - ✅ `player_archetypes_k8_2021-22.csv` (254 players)
  - ❌ `player_archetypes_k8_2022_23.csv` (NOT FOUND)
  - ✅ `player_archetypes_k8.csv` (generic, 254 players)

**Impact**: **MEDIUM** - The 2022-23 season is the validation holdout season. Without a proper archetype CSV file, we cannot generate the Z-matrix for validation possessions.

---

### 5. No Multi-Season Data Generation Script

**Issue**: No production-ready script exists to properly generate multi-season Bayesian training data from the 1,770,051 possession records in the database.

**What Exists**:
- ✅ `src/nba_stats/scripts/bayesian_data_prep.py` - Single-season (2022-23 only)
- ✅ `assign_historical_archetypes_pooled.py` - Generates archetype CSVs per season
- ❌ No script to combine multiple seasons into one training dataset

**Gap**: The current `bayesian_data_prep.py` hardcodes season-specific file paths and queries. It needs to be:
1. Season-agnostic
2. Pool data from multiple seasons
3. Generate matchup IDs correctly
4. Aggregate Z-matrices properly

**Impact**: **BLOCKER** - Phase 2 cannot proceed without this script.

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Phase 2.0.1: Create Proper Multi-Season Data Prep Script

**Objective**: Build a production-ready script that:
1. Loads ALL 1,770,051 possessions from 2018-19, 2020-21, 2021-22
2. Joins with player archetypes for each season
3. Loads DARKO ratings per season
4. Constructs proper matchup IDs (36 unique matchups)
5. Aggregates Z-matrices correctly for all 8 archetypes
6. Outputs complete training dataset

**Deliverables**:
- `generate_multi_season_bayesian_data.py`
- ~1.77M row training dataset with all 36 matchups
- Proper archetype 0-7 usage
- Validation that all 8 archetypes have non-zero aggregations

---

### Phase 2.0.2: Fix Archetype 0 Issue

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check if archetype IDs are 0-7 or 1-8
2. Verify Z-matrix indexing matches archetype IDs
3. Ensure archetype assignments include all 8 archetypes
4. Fix any index offset errors

**Deliverables**:
- All 8 archetypes (0-7) have proper non-zero aggregations
- Documented archetype ID convention

---

### Phase 2.0.3: Generate Missing 2022-23 Archetype CSV

**Task**: Extract archetype assignments from `PlayerArchetypeFeatures_2022_23` table and save as CSV.

**Deliverables**:
- `player_archetypes_k8_2022_23.csv`
- Format: `player_id, archetype_id`
- All 539 players included

---

### Phase 2.0.4: Validate Supercluster Mapping

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check if supercluster assignments are correct
2. Verify we have 6 distinct superclusters (not just 2)
3. Ensure matchup ID generation works for all combinations
4. Test that all 36 matchups can be generated

**Deliverables**:
- Functional supercluster mapping with 6 distinct superclusters
- All 36 matchups present in training data
- Proper matchup_id format

## Current vs. Expected State

| Component | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Training possessions | 1,770,051 | 231,310 (13.1%) | ❌ BLOCKER |
| Unique matchups | 36 | 3 | ❌ BLOCKER |
| Archetype 0 usage | >0 | 0 | ❌ BLOCKER |
| Historical CSVs | 3/3 | 2/3 | ⚠️ MEDIUM |
| Data generation script | Yes | No | ❌ BLOCKER |
| Database possessions | 1.77M | 1.77M | ✅ |
| Archetype tables | 4 seasons | 4 seasons | ✅ |
| DARKO ratings | All seasons | All seasons | ✅ |

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 2 is NOT ready to begin.** The following blockers must be resolved first:

1. ✅ Create proper multi-season data prep script
2. ✅ Fix archetype 0 usage issue
3. ✅ Validate supercluster mapping produces 36 matchups
4. ⚠️ Generate missing 2022-23 archetype CSV
5. ✅ Ensure complete coverage of all 1.77M possessions

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days to fix all blockers and validate the pipeline end-to-end.

**Recommendation**: Do NOT proceed with Phase 2 model training until these issues are resolved. Training on incomplete/broken data will produce invalid results.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create `generate_multi_season_bayesian_data.py` based on `bayesian_data_prep.py`
2. **Test**: Generate full 1.77M possession dataset
3. **Validate**: Check all 36 matchups present, all 8 archetypes used
4. **Fix**: Resolve archetype 0 issue
5. **Generate**: Create missing 2022-23 archetype CSV
6. **Re-test**: Validate complete pipeline end-to-end
7. **Proceed**: Only begin Phase 2 training after all validation passes
