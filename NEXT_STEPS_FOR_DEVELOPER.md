# Next Steps for Developer

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **MODEL TRAINED; READY FOR PAPER VALIDATION** — Training completed with strong convergence; proceed to implement case-study validation.

## 🎯 Current State

- ✅ **Production Dataset Ready**: The `production_bayesian_data.csv` file has been generated, corrected, and has passed a rigorous first-principles sanity check.
- ✅ **Critical Bug Fixed**: A bug in the outcome calculation logic within `bayesian_data_prep.py` has been resolved, and the data has been regenerated.
- ✅ **Project Unblocked**: All data-related tasks are complete. The sole focus is now on training and validating the Bayesian model.

## 🚀 Next Implementation Phase: Validate Against the Paper

Your entire focus is to use the prepared and validated dataset to train the Bayesian model and verify its correctness against the source paper.

### **Step 1: Use Trained Coefficients**

1. Ensure `model_coefficients.csv` exists in the project root. If missing, re-run training:
   ```bash
   python3 train_bayesian_model.py --data production_bayesian_data.csv --stan bayesian_model_k8.stan \
     --draws 2500 --tune 1500 --chains 4 --adapt-delta 0.9 --coefficients model_coefficients.csv
   ```

### **Step 2: Implement Paper-Case Validator**

Create or extend `validate_model.py` to:
1. Load `model_coefficients.csv`.
2. Initialize the shared `ModelEvaluator` with these coefficients.
3. Implement three checks from the paper (2022-23):
   - Lakers: 3&D/defensive guards rank above ball-handlers with LeBron+AD core.
   - Pacers: defensive archetypes rank above positional need at PF.
   - Suns: defensive bigs rank above offensive bigs alongside Booker/Durant/Beal.
4. Output `model_validation_report.json` with PASS/FAIL per case and brief notes.

Example CLI:
```bash
python3 validate_model.py --coefficients model_coefficients.csv --season 2022-23 \
  --cases lakers pacers suns --output model_validation_report.json
```

## 📁 Key Files and Locations

### **Input Data**
- **Bayesian Training Data**: `production_bayesian_data.csv` (primary input)
- **Stratified Sample**: `stratified_sample_10k.csv` (for quick tests)
- **Database (Source of Truth)**: `src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db`

### **Scripts to Run**
- `validate_model.py` (Implement and run this next)

### **Key Scripts (Already Implemented)**
- `src/nba_stats/scripts/bayesian_data_prep.py` (Data generation - **Complete**)
- `generate_lineup_superclusters.py` (Supercluster generation - **Complete**)
 - `train_bayesian_model.py` (Training - **Complete**)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The project will be successfully validated when:
1.  The `validate_model.py` script confirms that our model's predictions for the Lakers, Pacers, and Suns cases match the outcomes reported in the source paper.
