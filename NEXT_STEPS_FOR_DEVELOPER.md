# Next Steps for Developer

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **DATA VALIDATED & CORRECTED** — All data preparation and validation is complete. The project is ready for the final modeling phase.

## 🎯 Current State

- ✅ **Production Dataset Ready**: The `production_bayesian_data.csv` file has been generated, corrected, and has passed a rigorous first-principles sanity check.
- ✅ **Critical Bug Fixed**: A bug in the outcome calculation logic within `bayesian_data_prep.py` has been resolved, and the data has been regenerated.
- ✅ **Project Unblocked**: All data-related tasks are complete. The sole focus is now on training and validating the Bayesian model.

## 🚀 Next Implementation Phase: Train and Validate the Bayesian Model

Your entire focus is to use the prepared and validated dataset to train the Bayesian model and verify its correctness against the source paper.

### **Step 1: Train the Stan Model**

1.  Use the `train_bayesian_model.py` script to train the Stan model on the `production_bayesian_data.csv` dataset.
2.  This is a computationally intensive step and may take several hours. Monitor the script for convergence messages (`R-hat < 1.1`).

### **Step 2: Validate the Model Against the Paper**

1.  Once the model is trained and the coefficients are generated, run the `validate_model.py` script.
2.  This script will test the model's predictions against the specific team case studies (Lakers, Pacers, and Suns) published in the original research paper.
3.  **Success is achieved** when our model's outputs align with the paper's findings, proving that our implementation is a faithful and correct reproduction of the source methodology.

## 📁 Key Files and Locations

### **Input Data**
- **Bayesian Training Data**: `production_bayesian_data.csv` (primary input)
- **Stratified Sample**: `stratified_sample_10k.csv` (for quick tests)
- **Database (Source of Truth)**: `src/nba_stats/db/nba_stats.db`

### **Scripts to Run**
- `train_bayesian_model.py` (Run this first)
- `validate_model.py` (Run this second)

### **Key Scripts (Already Implemented)**
- `src/nba_stats/scripts/bayesian_data_prep.py` (Data generation - **Complete**)
- `generate_lineup_superclusters.py` (Supercluster generation - **Complete**)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The project will be successfully validated when:
1.  The Stan model trains successfully using `production_bayesian_data.csv`.
2.  The `validate_model.py` script confirms that our model's predictions for the Lakers, Pacers, and Suns cases match the outcomes reported in the source paper.
