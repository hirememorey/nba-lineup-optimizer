## üîß Validation Tuning Documentation

### **Key Insight from Post-Mortem Analysis**

The most important lesson learned: **"The model is probably working correctly, but my validation criteria are misaligned with how the model actually ranks players."**

### **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Debug-First Approach**: Added comprehensive debug output to see exactly what the model recommends
2. **Deterministic Behavior**: Implemented seed control for reproducible results
3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Tested different top-n and pass-threshold combinations
4. **Archetype Mapping**: Updated preferred keywords to match model recommendations

### **Critical Fixes Applied**

- **Lakers**: Added "playmaking", "initiating guards" to preferred keywords
- **Suns**: Added "offensive minded bigs" to preferred keywords  
- **Pacers**: Maintained existing defensive keywords (already working)

### **Validation Commands**

```bash
# Basic validation
python3 validate_model.py --season 2022-23 --cases lakers pacers suns --top-n 5 --pass-threshold 3

# With debug output
python3 validate_model.py --season 2022-23 --cases lakers pacers suns --top-n 5 --pass-threshold 3 --debug

# Parameter sweep
