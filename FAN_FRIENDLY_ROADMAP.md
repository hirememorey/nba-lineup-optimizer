# Fan-Friendly Enhancement Roadmap

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: üìã **PLANNING PHASE** - Ready for Implementation

## Project Vision

Transform the NBA Lineup Optimizer from a technical tool into a fan-friendly application that helps NBA fans understand which players would fit best on their favorite teams. The goal is to create real-world examples like explaining why Russell Westbrook struggled with the Lakers but succeeded with the Clippers and Nuggets, and eventually expand to evaluate G-League players for finding hidden gems.
