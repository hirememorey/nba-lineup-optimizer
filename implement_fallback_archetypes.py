Implement fallback archetype assignments for players missing from archetype generation.

This script addresses the critical data quality issue where 295 players (18.7% of minutes)
are missing archetype assignments because they played fewer than 1000 minutes.

Strategy:
1. For players with 500-999 minutes: Use a simple heuristic based on position and stats
2. For players with <500 minutes: Assign to "Role Players" (most common archetype)
3. Update the database with these fallback assignments
