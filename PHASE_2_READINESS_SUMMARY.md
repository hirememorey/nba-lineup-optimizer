# Phase 2 Readiness Summary

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ **BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED** - Investigation complete, issues documented

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive first-principles investigation of Phase 2 readiness revealed **two critical blockers** that must be addressed before multi-season Bayesian model training can proceed:

1. ❌ **Archetype Index Mismatch Bug** (Critical)
2. ❌ **Data Coverage Shortfall** (Expected, but requires understanding)

Both issues are documented with root cause analyses and recommended fixes.

## Critical Finding #1: Archetype 0 Bug

**Issue**: Archetype index mismatch causes column 0 to remain empty and archetype 8 data to be lost.

**Root Cause**: CSV archetype IDs are 1-8, but code accesses array indices 0-7.

**Impact**: 
- Column `z_off_0` always empty (should have archetype 1 data)
- Archetype 8 data stored in `z_off[8]` but never retrieved
- Model effectively trained on 7 archetypes instead of 8

**Fix**: Change line 26 in `src/nba_stats/scripts/bayesian_data_prep.py`:
```python
# Change from:
return pd.Series(df['archetype_id'].values, index=df['player_id']).to_dict()

# To:
return pd.Series(df['archetype_id'].values - 1, index=df['player_id']).to_dict()
```

**Reference**: See `ARCHETYPE_0_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` for full details.

## Critical Finding #2: Data Coverage Shortfall

**Issue**: `multi_season_bayesian_data.csv` contains only 231,310 rows (13.1%) instead of 1,770,051.

**Root Cause**: Ultra-strict filtering requires ALL 10 players to have complete data (archetype + DARKO).

**Analysis**:
- ✅ All eligible players (1000+ minutes) HAVE archetype assignments
- ⚠️ Only ~45% of possession players meet 1000-minute threshold
- ⚠️ With 5-on-5 basketball, this causes 87% data loss

**Verdict**: **This is expected per paper's methodology** (1000-minute requirement for representative samples).

**Assessment**: 231K possessions is likely sufficient for initial training (paper used 612K for single season).

**Reference**: See `DATA_COVERAGE_SHORTFALL_INVESTIGATION.md` and `ARCHETYPE_ASSIGNMENT_ELIGIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md` for full details.

## Phase 2 Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Ready to Proceed

- [x] All 1,770,051 possessions in database
- [x] Archetype features generated for all historical seasons
- [x] DARKO ratings available for all seasons
- [x] Archetype assignments complete (100% of eligible players)
- [x] Possessions, archetypes, DARKO all linked correctly
- [x] 231K training-ready possessions identified

### ❌ Blockers to Fix

- [ ] **Archetype index mismatch** - Fix Z-matrix column mapping
- [ ] **Missing 2022-23 archetype CSV** - Generate for validation holdout
- [ ] **Supercluster mapping** - Only 3 matchups instead of 36
- [ ] **Data generation script** - Need proper multi-season data prep script

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Phase 2 Training)

1. **Fix archetype index bug** in `bayesian_data_prep.py`
2. **Generate missing 2022-23 archetype CSV** for validation
3. **Investigate supercluster mapping** to ensure 36 unique matchups
4. **Create proper multi-season data prep script**

### Short-Term (During/After Phase 2)

5. **Train initial model** on 231K possessions (proceed with current data)
6. **Validate model** on 2022-23 holdout season
7. **Test Russell Westbrook-Lakers case study**

### Long-Term (Optional Enhancement)

8. **Expand archetype coverage** to <1000 minute players (optional)
9. **Regenerate dataset** with expanded coverage if desired
10. **Retrain model** with full dataset

## Investigation Documentation

The following documents contain detailed findings:

1. **ARCHETYPE_0_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md** - Index mismatch bug analysis
2. **DATA_COVERAGE_SHORTFALL_INVESTIGATION.md** - Why 87% of data is dropped
3. **ARCHETYPE_ASSIGNMENT_ELIGIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md** - Eligibility verification
4. **PHASE_2_READINESS_AUDIT.md** - Complete audit results

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: **NOT READY for Phase 2 training yet** - Critical bug must be fixed first.

**Estimated Time to Fix**: 1-2 hours (fix archetype mapping, regenerate data, verify)

**Recommendation**: Fix blockers, regenerate training data, then proceed with Phase 2 training.
