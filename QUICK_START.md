# Quick Start: Where to Begin

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**For**: New developer picking up this project  
**Goal**: Deploy matchup-specific model training on RunPod

## Read These First (in order)

1. **`DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md`** (5 min read)
   - What was accomplished
   - Why matchup-specific model matters
   - Current state and next steps

2. **`RUNPOD_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** (3 min read)
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - How to monitor progress
   - Expected timeline and costs

3. **`STATUS.md`** (Current status section at top)
   - High-level project state
   - What works, what needs doing

## Files Ready for Deployment

âœ… **Data**: `matchup_specific_bayesian_data_full.csv` (96,837 possessions, 32 matchups)  
âœ… **Model**: `bayesian_model_k8_matchup_specific.stan` (612 parameters)  
âœ… **Script**: `train_full_matchup_specific_runpod.py` (training automation)  
âœ… **Guide**: `RUNPOD_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (deployment instructions)  

## What to Do Right Now

### Option A: Deploy on RunPod (Recommended)

```bash
# Review the deployment guide
cat RUNPOD_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

# Follow the manual deployment steps
# This will take 30-40 hours and cost $50-100
```

### Option B: Use Existing Simplified Model

```bash
# Already works! Use it for production
# File: model_coefficients.csv

# Limitations: Can't detect skill-context interactions
# But works perfectly for redundancy detection
```

## Expected Outcomes

**If RunPod training succeeds**:
- 612 matchup-specific coefficients
- 24/36 matchups should converge well
- More insights than simplified model
- Use for production

**If RunPod training fails**:
- Use simplified model (already validated)
- Consider reduced architecture (top 25 matchups only)
- Or accept limitations of simplified model

## Key Context

**Why this matters**:
- Simplified model only detects redundancy ("same archetype")
- Matchup-specific model would detect skill-context interactions
- This addresses your critical insight about LeBron vs. Westbrook skill differences

**What was discovered**:
- Pre-mortem validation caught data generation bug
- All possessions were being assigned to matchup 35 (fixed!)
- Subsample training failed due to overparameterization
- Full dataset (96K) has enough data to potentially work

**Next**: Deploy full training on RunPod and see if it converges
