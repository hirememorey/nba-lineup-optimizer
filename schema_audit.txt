# Database Schema Audit Report
# Generated: $(date)
# Phase 1.1.2: Database Schema Verification

## Summary
- Total tables found: 44
- Tables with season columns: 3+ (PlayerSeasonRawStats, PlayerSeasonSkill, Games)
- Season-specific tables: 3 (PlayerSeasonRawStats_2022_23, PlayerSeasonAdvancedStats_2022_23, PlayerArchetypeFeatures_2022_23)
- Tables with composite primary keys: 2+ (PlayerSeasonRawStats, PlayerSeasonSkill)

## Tables with Season Columns (Multi-Season Ready)
- PlayerSeasonRawStats: (player_id, season, team_id) - COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY
- PlayerSeasonSkill: (player_id, season) - COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY  
- Games: (game_id) - season column present but not in primary key

## Season-Specific Tables (Single-Season Only)
- PlayerSeasonRawStats_2022_23
- PlayerSeasonAdvancedStats_2022_23
- PlayerArchetypeFeatures_2022_23

## Key Tables Needing Verification
- PlayerSeasonAdvancedStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonDriveStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonHustleStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonPassingStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonPostUpStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonReboundingStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonShootingRangeStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonShootingZoneStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonTrackingTouchesStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonElbowTouchStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonPaintTouchStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonCatchAndShootStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonPullUpStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonOpponentShootingStats: Need to check if has season column
- PlayerSeasonDerivedShotStats: Need to check if has season column

## Critical Findings

### 1. Mixed Schema State
- Some tables are multi-season ready (PlayerSeasonRawStats, PlayerSeasonSkill)
- Some tables are season-specific (PlayerSeasonRawStats_2022_23, etc.)
- Need to verify all PlayerSeason* tables have season columns

### 2. Primary Key Structure
- PlayerSeasonRawStats: (player_id, season, team_id) - GOOD
- PlayerSeasonSkill: (player_id, season) - GOOD
- Games: (game_id) - season not in primary key, but this might be OK

### 3. Season-Specific Tables
- These appear to be backups or special-purpose tables
- Need to understand their relationship to main tables
- May need to be updated for multi-season support

## Recommendations

### Phase 1.2: Complete Schema Verification
Need to check ALL PlayerSeason* tables for:
1. Season column presence
2. Composite primary key structure
3. Data integrity constraints

### Phase 1.3: Schema Migration Plan
If any tables are missing season columns:
1. Add season column
2. Update primary key to include season
3. Migrate existing data
4. Verify data integrity

### Phase 1.4: Season-Specific Table Strategy
Decide what to do with season-specific tables:
1. Keep as backups
2. Migrate to multi-season tables
3. Delete if redundant

## Next Steps
1. Complete verification of all PlayerSeason* tables
2. Identify tables needing schema migration
3. Plan migration strategy for multi-season support
4. Test schema changes on sandbox database first
