Gradient evaluation took 2.4e-05 seconds
1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.24 seconds.
Adjust your expectations accordingly!


WARNING: There aren't enough warmup iterations to fit the
         three stages of adaptation as currently configured.
         Reducing each adaptation stage to 15%/75%/10% of
         the given number of warmup iterations:
           init_buffer = 7
           adapt_window = 38
           term_buffer = 5

Iteration:  1 / 100 [  1%]  (Warmup)
Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter[1] is inf, but must be finite! (in 'bayesian_model_k8_matchup_specific.stan', line 34, column 4 to column 26)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Iteration: 51 / 100 [ 51%]  (Sampling)
Iteration: 100 / 100 [100%]  (Sampling)

 Elapsed Time: 0.033 seconds (Warm-up)
               0.03 seconds (Sampling)
