# Data Quality Issues Report

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**  
**Impact**: Archetype clustering system is unreliable for production use

## Executive Summary

While the technical infrastructure of the NBA Lineup Optimizer is fully functional, critical data quality issues have been discovered that render the player archetype clustering system unreliable. The system is clustering players based on incomplete and missing data, resulting in nonsensical archetype assignments.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Essential Features

**Problem**: Critical features required for proper archetype classification are completely missing.

| Feature | Description | Coverage | Impact |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `AVGDIST` | Average shot distance | 0/270 (0%) | **CRITICAL** - Essential for distinguishing shooters |
| `Zto3r` | Zone to 3-point range | 0/270 (0%) | **CRITICAL** - Shot selection patterns |
| `THto10r` | 3-10 foot range | 0/270 (0%) | **HIGH** - Mid-range shooting |
| `TENto16r` | 10-16 foot range | 0/270 (0%) | **HIGH** - Mid-range shooting |
| `SIXTto3PTr` | 16+ foot to 3PT range | 0/270 (0%) | **HIGH** - Long-range shooting |

### 2. Sparse Advanced Features

**Problem**: Most tracking and advanced features are missing or zero.

| Feature Category | Coverage | Examples |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Drive Statistics | 0/270 (0%) | `DRIVES`, `DRFGA`, `DRPTSPCT` |
| Catch & Shoot | 0/270 (0%) | `CSFGA`, `CS3PA` |
| Pull-up Shooting | 0/270 (0%) | `PUFGA`, `PU3PA` |
| Post-up Play | 0/270 (0%) | `PSTUPFGA`, `PSTUPPTSPCT` |
| Paint Touches | 0/270 (0%) | `PNTTOUCH`, `PNTFGA` |

### 3. Incomplete Physical Data

**Problem**: Anthropometric data is incomplete.

| Feature | Coverage | Impact |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `HEIGHT` | 178/270 (66%) | **MEDIUM** - Affects position classification |
| `WINGSPAN` | 184/270 (68%) | **MEDIUM** - Defensive potential |

### 4. Nonsensical Archetype Assignments

**Problem**: The clustering algorithm produces clearly incorrect results.

| Player | Assigned Archetype | Expected Archetype | Issue |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Stephen Curry | 3&D | Offensive Juggernaut | Wrong - Curry is elite shooter, not 3&D |
| Victor Wembanyama | Non-Shooting, Defensive Minded Bigs | Offensive Minded Bigs | Wrong - Wembanyama is excellent shooter |
| Nikola Jokic | 3&D | Offensive Juggernaut | Wrong - Jokic is offensive genius, not 3&D |

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Data Pipeline Failures

The advanced tracking features are not being populated by the data pipeline. This suggests:

- **API Integration Issues**: The NBA Stats API may not be returning the expected data
- **Data Processing Errors**: The feature extraction logic may be failing silently
- **Schema Mismatches**: The database schema may not match the API response structure

### 2. Feature Selection Problems

The 48 features selected for clustering include many that are not available, making the clustering algorithm unreliable.

### 3. Clustering Algorithm Issues

With most features missing or zero, the K-means algorithm is essentially clustering on:
- Basic shooting percentages (FTPCT, TSPCT)
- Limited physical data (HEIGHT, WINGSPAN)
- Mostly zeros for advanced features

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact

1. **Archetype Classifications**: Completely unreliable
2. **Player Acquisition Tool**: Will provide incorrect recommendations
3. **Lineup Analysis**: Based on flawed player categorizations
4. **Model Training**: Real Bayesian model would be trained on incorrect data

### Business Impact

1. **User Trust**: System provides obviously wrong recommendations
2. **Production Readiness**: Cannot be deployed with current data quality
3. **Research Validity**: Results cannot be trusted for decision-making

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term (Immediate)

1. **Manual Archetype Assignment**: Create a manual override system for known players
2. **Simplified Clustering**: Use only the features that are actually populated
3. **Data Validation**: Add comprehensive data quality checks

### Medium-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Fix Data Pipeline**: Investigate and fix the advanced feature extraction
2. **API Integration**: Ensure all required data is being fetched correctly
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create reliable features from available data

### Long-term (1 month)

1. **Complete Data Audit**: Verify all 48 features are properly populated
2. **Clustering Validation**: Test archetype assignments against basketball knowledge
3. **Production Deployment**: Only deploy when data quality is verified

## Files Affected

- `PlayerArchetypeFeatures` table - Missing most advanced features
- `PlayerSeasonArchetypes` table - Contains incorrect assignments
- `src/nba_stats/scripts/generate_archetype_features.py` - Feature extraction logic
- `src/nba_stats/scripts/run_phase_1.py` - Clustering algorithm

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Document this issue and update all relevant documentation
2. **Investigation**: Debug the data pipeline to identify why features are missing
3. **Fix**: Implement proper data collection and feature extraction
4. **Validation**: Re-run clustering with complete data and validate results

## Conclusion

The NBA Lineup Optimizer has excellent technical architecture and infrastructure, but the data quality issues make it unsuitable for production use until resolved. The archetype clustering system must be rebuilt with reliable data before the system can provide trustworthy recommendations.

**This issue must be resolved before any production deployment or real-world usage of the player acquisition recommendations.**
