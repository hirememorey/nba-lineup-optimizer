# API Fixes Summary - September 30, 2025

## Problem Resolved
The NBA data pipeline was failing due to API connectivity issues that were preventing data collection for the 2024-25 season.

## Root Cause
The Python client (`src/nba_stats/api/nba_stats_client.py`) had hardcoded season parameters set to `2023-24` instead of the current `2024-25` season in multiple methods.

## Solution Applied
Updated the following methods in `nba_stats_client.py`:
- `get_all_teams()`: Fixed hardcoded `2023-24` to use parameter
- `get_players_with_stats()`: Fixed season parameter handling
- `get_team_stats()`: Fixed season parameter handling
- Default season fallback: Updated from `2023-24` to `2024-25`

## Verification Results
- **API Health**: ✅ All endpoints working (30 teams, 569 players)
- **Data Quality**: ✅ 100% pass rate on all 16 semantic checks
- **Critical Metrics**: ✅ All essential stats available (FTPCT, TSPCT, THPAr, FTr, TRBPCT)
- **Player Coverage**: ✅ Complete data for key players (LeBron, Harden, Wembanyama)

## Files Modified
- `src/nba_stats/api/nba_stats_client.py` - Fixed hardcoded seasons
- `docs/api_debugging_methodology.md` - Updated with successful resolution
- `docs/quick_start.md` - Updated status to operational
- `docs/implementation_guide.md` - Updated status to operational
- `docs/data_pipeline.md` - Updated status to operational

## Next Steps
The data pipeline is now ready for production use:
```bash
python master_data_pipeline.py --season 2024-25
```

## Key Learning
The "isolate with curl first" principle was crucial in identifying that the issue was parameter-related, not header-related. This demonstrates the importance of testing external dependencies before debugging internal code.
