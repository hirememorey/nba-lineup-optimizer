"""
Populate Player Anthropometric Data from NBA Draft Combine.

This script fetches wingspan and other physical measurements from the NBA Draft Combine
API and populates the PlayerAnthroStats table. The data is highly sparse, only available
for players who attended the draft combine.

The script is designed to be:
- Idempotent: Can be run multiple times safely
- Resilient: Handles API failures gracefully
- Dependency-aware: Checks for required upstream data
